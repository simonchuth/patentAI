DETAILED DESCRIPTION In accordance with various embodiments, mechanisms (which can include methods, systems, and media) for indicating viewership of a video are provided. In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can cause indications of viewers who have previously viewed, endorsed, shared, and/or received suggestions to view a particular video to be presented to a first user who is browsing a list of videos. In some embodiments, the viewers can correspond to connections of the first user, such as those who are directly connected to the first user on a social networking service, belong to the same group on a social networking service, and/or have any other suitable connection to the first user. In some embodiments, the indications can include a name of the viewer and/or an image representing the viewer, and the indications can be presented in connection with an identifier of the particular video, thereby allowing the first user browsing the list of videos to quickly identify friends who have watched and/or endorsed the video. In some embodiments, the indications can be presented as belonging to different categories. For example, in some embodiments, the categories can include: users that have endorsed a video, users that have received suggestions to view the video, groups the first user belongs to that have received a suggestion to view the video, users that have suggested that other users view the video, and/or friends that have been identified as likely to enjoy the video. In some such embodiments, viewer indicators can be displayed in any suitable manner that indicates which category the corresponding viewer belongs to. Additionally, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can cause a user included in one category to be removed from the other categories. In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can identify users corresponding to the viewership indicators and store indications of the identified users for later use, as shown in and described below in connection with FIG. 6 . For example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms can identify the users corresponding to the different categories of viewership indicators for a particular video and can store the user identifiers (e.g., in a cache on a server), and the user identifiers can then be retrieved at a later time, for example, in response to a request from a user device to present a page that includes an indication of the video (e.g., a list of videos that includes the video, a page that includes a thumbnail image associated with the video, and/or any other suitable indication of the video). In some embodiments, the mechanisms can identify users based on interactions with content that are shared by the users publicly. For example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms can identify a user's interactions with content while signed in to a particular user account. Additionally, in instances where the mechanisms do not identify any users, the mechanisms can cause the viewership indicators to be omitted from presentation. Note that, although the mechanisms described herein relate to indicating viewership of a video, in some embodiments, the mechanisms can be used to indicate viewership of any suitable type of media content, such as audio content (e.g., music, radio programs, audiobooks, and/or any other suitable type of audio content), television programs, movies, live streaming media content, electronic books, and/or any other suitable type of media content. Turning to FIG. 1 , an example 100 of a user interface for indicating viewership of a video is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. As illustrated, user interface 100 can include video indicator 102 and a panel of user indicators 104 . Video indicator 102 can be related to any suitable video. For example, in some embodiments, video indicator 102 can include an icon and/or title of a video from a list and/or group of videos that a user is browsing. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, video indicator 102 can be a thumbnail image associated with the video. As shown in user interface 102 , in some embodiments, video indicator 102 can include any suitable images, icons, graphics, animations, hyperlinks, titles, and/or any other suitable content. For example, in some embodiments, video indicator 102 can include a title of the video, a creator of the video, and/or any other suitable information. Panel 104 can indicate users who have watched the video corresponding to video indicator 102 , users who have endorsed and/or liked the video, users who have received suggestions to watch the video, users who have recommended the video to others, and/or users that have been identified as likely to enjoy the video. In some embodiments, the users indicated in panel 104 can be connections of a first user browsing a list of videos. For example, in some embodiments, the indicated users can be a direct connection of the first user on a social networking service (e.g., friends of the first user, and/or any other suitable type of direct connection) or an indirect connection of the first user on the social networking service (e.g., a friend of a friend, and/or any other suitable type of indirect connection). As another example, in some embodiments, the users indicated in panel 104 and the first user browsing the list of videos can belong to a group on a social networking service, have subscribed to a channel of media content, and/or have indicated interest in a similar topic. As shown in panel 104 , users indicated in panel 104 can be subdivided into different categories, each of which indicates a different type of interest in the video. For example, in some embodiments, the categories can include: users who endorsed the video (e.g., by &#x201c;liking&#x201d; the video, commenting on the video, and/or any other suitable type of endorsement, users who have received suggestions to view the video (e.g., by another user sharing the video and/or a link to the video, and/or in any other suitable manner), groups of users that have received suggestions to view the video (e.g., due to the video being posted on a page corresponding to the group, due to the video being sent to all members of the group, and/or in any other suitable manner), users who have shared the video with other users, and users who have been identified as likely to enjoy the video. In some embodiments, each category can be grouped in any suitable manner, as shown in user interface 100 by groups 106 , 108 , 110 , 112 , and 114 . In some embodiments, users who appear in one category can be inhibited from appearing in any other category in panel 104 , as described below in connection with FIGS. 4 and 5 . In some embodiments, any suitable visual indicator can be used to separate categories within panel 104 , such as a line between categories, a box around each category, and/or any other suitable visual indicator. Alternatively, in some embodiments, a visual indicator to separate categories within panel 104 can be omitted. Note that, although five categories are shown in panel 104 and are described herein, in some embodiments, any suitable number (e.g., one, two, four, ten, and/or any other suitable number) of categories can be included. Users and/or groups indicated in panel 104 can be indicated with an icon, a name, and/or any other suitable information, as shown by user indicator 116 in user interface 100 . For example, in some embodiments, user indicator 116 can include a name of the user. As another example, in some embodiments, user indicator 116 can include an image and/or icon representing the user. Note that, in some embodiments, indicators corresponding to different groups can be presented in different manners. For example, in some embodiments, indicators corresponding to a group of users who have been identified as likely to enjoy the video can be presented with a different color scheme (e.g., in black and white, using transparency, and/or any other suitable color scheme) compared to indicators corresponding to a group of users who have endorsed the video. In some embodiments, user indicator 116 can include any other suitable information, such as an indication of whether the user is currently active on a site associated with user interface 100 , an icon indicating a social networking platform from which the user shared and/or endorsed a content item, and/or any other suitable information. Note that, in some embodiments, selection of user indicator 116 can cause any suitable action to occur. For example, in some embodiments, selection of user indicator 116 can cause a profile page associated with the user and/or group to be presented. As another example, in some embodiments, selection of an icon indicating a social networking platform on which the video was shared can cause a browser window presenting user interface 100 to navigate to a page presenting a post in which the video was shared. Note that user interface is shown as an example of a user interface for presenting viewership indicators, and in some embodiments, the viewership indicators can be presented in any other suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, user indicators can be presented without an indication of a category to which the corresponding user belongs. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, user indicators from multiple categories (e.g., friends who liked the video, friends who have tagged others to view the video, and/or any other categories) can be presented within panel 104 without text indicating each group. Turning to FIG. 2 , an example 200 of hardware for indicating viewership of a video that can be used in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As illustrated, hardware 200 can include one or more servers such as a data server 202 , a communication network 204 , and/or one or more user devices 206 , such as user devices 208 and 210 . In some embodiments, data server 202 can be any suitable server for storing information relating to users who have viewed a video, users who have endorsed a video, users who have tagged a connection to view a video, and/or any other suitable information. In some embodiments, data server 202 can use the stored information to create indications of users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended a particular video. For example, in some embodiments, the indications can be presented to a first user, for example, if the first user is browsing a list of videos. In some such embodiments, the users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended the particular video can be friends of the first user. In some embodiments, data server 202 can additionally maintain any suitable lists and/or graphs of relationships between users that can be used to create the indications of users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended the video. In some embodiments, data server 202 can identify users corresponding to the viewership indicators at a first time and can store indications of the identified users for presentation at any suitable later time, as shown in and described below in connection with FIG. 6 . In some embodiments, data server 202 can be omitted. Communication network 204 can be any suitable combination of one or more wired and/or wireless networks in some embodiments. For example, communication network 206 can include any one or more of the Internet, an intranet, a wide-area network (WAN), a local-area network (LAN), a wireless network, a digital subscriber line (DSL) network, a frame relay network, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, a virtual private network (VPN), and/or any other suitable communication network. User devices 206 can be connected by one or more communications links 212 to communication network 204 that can be linked via one or more communications links (e.g., communications link 214 ) to data server 202 . Communications links 212 and/or 214 can be any communications links suitable for communicating data among user devices 206 and server 202 such as network links, dial-up links, wireless links, hard-wired links, any other suitable communications links, or any suitable combination of such links. In some embodiments, user devices 206 can include one or more computing devices suitable for browsing a listing of videos, viewing a video, recommending a video, endorsing a video, suggesting a video to another user, and/or any other suitable functions. For example, in some embodiments, user devices 206 can be implemented as a mobile device, such as a smartphone, mobile phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a vehicle (e.g., a car, a boat, an airplane, or any other suitable vehicle) entertainment system, a portable media player, and/or any other suitable mobile device. As another example, in some embodiments, user devices 206 can be implemented as a non-mobile device such as a desktop computer, a set-top box, a television, a streaming media player, a game console, and/or any other suitable non-mobile device. Although data server 202 is illustrated as a single device, the functions performed by data server 202 can be performed using any suitable number of devices in some embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the functions performed by data server 202 can be performed on a single server. As another example, in some embodiments, multiple devices can be used to implement the functions performed by data server 202 . Although two user devices 208 and 210 are shown in FIG. 2 , any suitable number of user devices, and/or any suitable types of user devices, can be used in some embodiments. Data server 202 and user devices 206 can be implemented using any suitable hardware in some embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, devices 202 and 206 can be implemented using any suitable general purpose computer or special purpose computer. For example, a server may be implemented using a special purpose computer. Any such general purpose computer or special purpose computer can include any suitable hardware. For example, as illustrated in example hardware 300 of FIG. 3 , such hardware can include hardware processor 302 , memory and/or storage 304 , an input device controller 306 , an input device 308 , display/audio drivers 310 , display and audio output circuitry 312 , communication interface(s) 314 , an antenna 316 , and a bus 318 . Hardware processor 302 can include any suitable hardware processor, such as a microprocessor, a micro-controller, digital signal processor(s), dedicated logic, and/or any other suitable circuitry for controlling the functioning of a general purpose computer or a special purpose computer in some embodiments. In some embodiments, hardware processor 302 can be controlled by a server program stored in memory and/or storage 304 of a server (e.g., such as server 202 ). For example, the server program can cause hardware processor 302 to store indications of users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended a video, present an indication of connections of a user who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended the video, and/or perform any other suitable actions. In some embodiments, hardware processor 302 can be controlled by a computer program stored in memory and/or storage 304 of user device 206 . For example, the computer program can cause hardware processor 302 to present indications of users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended a video, and/or perform any other suitable actions.

For example, input device controller 306 can be circuitry for receiving input from a touchscreen, from a keyboard, from a mouse, from one or more buttons, from a voice recognition circuit, from a microphone, from a camera, from an optical sensor, from an accelerometer, from a temperature sensor, from a near field sensor, and/or any other type of input device. Display/audio drivers 310 can be any suitable circuitry for controlling and driving output to one or more display/audio output devices 312 in some embodiments. For example, display/audio drivers 310 can be circuitry for driving a touchscreen, a flat-panel display, a cathode ray tube display, a projector, a speaker or speakers, and/or any other suitable display and/or presentation devices. Communication interface(s) 314 can be any suitable circuitry for interfacing with one or more communication networks, such as network 204 as shown in FIG. 2 . For example, interface(s) 314 can include network interface card circuitry, wireless communication circuitry, and/or any other suitable type of communication network circuitry. Antenna 316 can be any suitable one or more antennas for wirelessly communicating with a communication network (e.g., communication network 204 ) in some embodiments. In some embodiments, antenna 316 can be omitted. Bus 318 can be any suitable mechanism for communicating between two or more components 302 , 304 , 306 , 310 , and 314 in some embodiments. Any other suitable components can be included in hardware 300 in accordance with some embodiments. Turning to FIG. 4 , an example 400 of a process for indicating viewership of a video is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In some embodiments, blocks of process 400 can be executed on data server 202 and/or user device 206 . Process 400 can begin by receiving an indication that viewership information is to be provided to a user at 402 . Process 400 can receive the indication in response to any action and/or information. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can receive the indication in response to determining that a particular page is to be presented. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, the particular page can correspond to a home page of a video sharing service, a home page corresponding to a user account associated with the user for a video sharing service, a page associated with a particular channel of media content on a video sharing service, and/or any other suitable type of page. As another example, in some embodiments, process 400 can receive the indication in response to determining that a first user is browsing a listing of videos, and can determine that information about a particular video in the listing is to be provided (e.g., by determining that the user has selected the particular video, by determining that a cursor is hovering over an icon associated with the particular video, and/or based on any other suitable information). As described above in connection with FIG. 1 , in some embodiments, the viewers of the video can be restricted to direct and/or indirect connections (e.g., on a social networking service) of the first user. Process 400 can identify connections (direct and/or indirect) of the user who have endorsed the video at 404 . For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify connections of the user who have indicated that they watched and liked the video, and/or endorsed the video in any other suitable manner. Process 400 can use any suitable technique or combination of techniques to identify the connections of the user. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can query a database (e.g., on data server 202 ) for users who have both endorsed the video and are connected to the first user. In some such embodiments, process 400 can specify any suitable level of connection. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify only users who are directly connected to the first user, users who are connected by less than a predetermined degree of separation, and/or based on any other suitable criteria. Alternatively, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users who belong to a particular group with the first user and/or who have subscribed to a channel of a media content with the first user. Note that, in some embodiments, the connections identified at block 404 can correspond to the users displayed in category 106 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . A more particular example of a process for identifying connections of the user who have endorsed the video is shown in and described below in connection with FIG. 6 . Note that, in some embodiments, process 400 can additionally or alternatively identify groups that have endorsed the channel of media content or the video. For example, in some embodiments, the groups can include a group on a social networking service, channels of media content available on a video sharing service, and/or any other suitable type of group(s). Process 400 can identify connections of the first user who have received suggestions to view the video at 406 . In some embodiments, the identified users can be those who have received a message with a link to the video, users who have had the video posted on a profile page on a social networking service by another user, and/or received a suggestion to view the video in any other suitable manner. As described above, the identified users can be connected to the first user directly or indirectly in any suitable manner. Similarly to at block 404 , the users can be identified using any suitable techniques, for example, by querying a database. Note that, in some embodiments, the connections identified at block 406 can correspond to the users displayed in category 108 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . Process 400 can identify groups that have received suggestions to view the video at 408 . In some embodiments, the identified groups can be ones that the first user belongs to. For example, in some embodiments, the groups can include those that the user has joined on a social networking service, groups that correspond to users who have subscribed to a particular channel of media content, and/or any other suitable groups. Similarly to at blocks 404 and 406 , the groups can be identified using any suitable techniques, for example, by querying a database. Note that, in some embodiments, the groups identified at block 408 can correspond to the group(s) displayed in category 110 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . Process 400 can identify connections of the first user who have shared the video with other users at 410 . For example, in some embodiments, the identified connections can include those who have sent a message to another user that includes the video and/or a link to the video, those who have posted the video and/or a link to the video on a page associated with another user, and/or those who have shared the video in any other suitable manner. Similarly to at blocks 404 - 408 , the users can be identified using any suitable techniques, for example, by querying a database. Note that, in some embodiments, the users identified at block 410 can correspond to the users displayed in category 112 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . Process 400 can identify connections of the first user who are likely to enjoy the video at 412 based on any suitable information. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users connected to the first user who have endorsed similar videos. As a more particular example, if the video relates to a particular topic, process 400 can identify connections of the user who have previously endorsed videos related to the topic. As another example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users connected to the first user who are interested in a topic associated with the video. In some such embodiments, the users can be identified based on collections of video content the user has subscribed to and/or otherwise endorsed, interests indicated on a social networking service, and/or using any other suitable information. As yet another example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users connected to the first user who have endorsed videos determined to be similar to videos viewed by the first user. In some such embodiments, similarity can be determined using any suitable information, such as metadata indicating topics of the videos, creators of the videos, and/or any other suitable information. Note that, in some embodiments, the users identified at block 412 can correspond to the users displayed in category 114 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . Process 400 can create one or more groups of indicators relating to the connections and groups identified in blocks 404 - 412 at 414 . For example, as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 , the group of indicators can include those presented in panel 104 of user interface 100 . As shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 , each group of indicators can correspond to a category (e.g., users that have endorsed content, users that have tagged another user to view content, users determined to be likely to enjoy the content, and/or any other suitable categories, as described above). Additionally, each group of indicators can include any suitable number of user indicators, as shown in panel 104 of FIG. 1 . Similarly to user indicator 116 in FIG. 1 , each indicator can include a name of the user and/or group, an icon and/or image representing the user and/or group, and/or any other suitable information. Note that, in some embodiments, any suitable number of indicators can be created. For example, in some embodiments, an indicator corresponding to each identified connection and/or group can be created. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, indicators corresponding to a subset of the identified connections and/or groups can be created. In some such embodiments, process 400 can identify any suitable subset. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users and/or groups based on a level of interaction with the first user (e.g., users and/or groups the first user has most recently interacted with, users and/or groups the first user has interacted with the most number of times, and/or any other suitable metric), and/or based on any other suitable criteria. In some embodiments, each category represented in panel 104 can include a different number of user indicators, and any suitable number of indicators can be included in each category. Note that, in some embodiments, process 400 can deduplicate users represented in multiple categories. For example, if a particular user has both endorsed the video and has shared the video with other users, process 400 can remove the user from one of the two categories. In some embodiments, inclusion in categories can be ranked and/or ordered. For example, in some embodiments, the ordering of categories can be: users who have endorsed a video, users who have received suggestions to view the video, groups which have received suggestions to view the video, users who have shared the video with others, and users who have been identified as likely to enjoy the video. In some embodiments, users that can belong to more than one category can be placed in the highest-ranking category and removed from all other categories. A process for modifying a category that a user belongs to is shown in and described below in connection with FIG. 5 . Process 400 can cause the group of indicators to be presented on a user device associated with the first user at 416 . For example, as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 , process 400 can cause the group of indicators to be presented in connection with an indicator (e.g., a thumbnail image associated with the video, and/or any other suitable indicator) of the video. As another example, in some embodiments, the groups of indicators can be grouped into multiple categories, as shown in panel 104 of FIG. 1 . Turning to FIG. 5 , an example 500 of a process for storing indications of viewership of a video is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. Note that although process 500 describes storing indications of users sharing a video and endorsing a video, the techniques described below can be applied to any suitable actions. In some embodiments, blocks of process 500 can be executed by data server 202 . Process 500 can begin by receiving an indication that a first user has recommended that a second user watch a video at 502 . As described above in connection with FIGS. 1 and 4 , the first user and the second user can be connected in any suitable manner (e.g., a direct connection on a social networking service, an indirect connection on a social networking service, both belong to a particular group on a social networking service, both have subscribed to media content associated with a particular channel, and/or any other suitable type of connection). The recommendation can be made in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the first user can send the second user a message that includes a link to the video. Process 500 can store an indication that the first user recommended and/or shared the video at 504 . In some embodiments, the indication can be stored in any suitable location (e.g., in memory 304 of data server 202 ) and using any suitable techniques. For example, in some embodiments, the indication can be stored in a database with an identifier associated with the first user as a key. In some embodiments, the stored indication can cause the first user to be identified by process 400 at block 410 (e.g., to identify users that have shared a video with other users). Process 500 can store an indication that the second user has received a suggestion to view the video at 506 . Similarly to at block 504 , the indication can be stored in any suitable location using any suitable techniques, such as in a database in data server 202 . In some embodiments, the stored indication can cause the second user to be identified by process 400 at block 406 (e.g., to identify users that have received a suggestion to view the video). Process 500 can receive an indication that the second user has endorsed the video at 508 . For example, in some embodiments, process 500 can receive information indicating that the second user selected a link associated with the video and, after presentation of the video, indicated that they enjoyed the video (e.g., by selecting an icon indicating that they liked the video) and/or endorsed the video in any suitable manner. Process 500 can store an indication that the second user endorsed the video at 510 . Similarly to blocks 504 and 506 , the indication can be stored in any suitable location using any suitable techniques, such as in a database in data server 202 . In some embodiments, the stored indication can cause the second user to be identified by process 400 at block 404 (e.g., to identify users that have endorsed the video). Process 500 can additionally remove the indication stored at block 506 that indicates that the second user received the suggestion to view the video in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, process 500 can change a flag setting associated with the second user that indicates whether the second user received a suggestion to view the video. Note that, in some embodiments, process 500 can store indications for a particular user to ensure that only a predetermined number of indications have been stored for that user. For example, in some embodiments, if an indication that a user has endorsed a particular video has been stored, process 500 can remove indications that the user was likely to enjoy the video, that the user received a suggestion to view the video, and/or any other suitable indications. In some embodiments, process 500 can prioritize indications in any suitable order, for example, by prioritizing an indication that the user endorsed the video over an indication that the user received a suggestion to view the video, that the user is likely to enjoy the video, and/or that the user suggested the video to another user. In some embodiments, removing and/or deleting multiple indications can be used to deduplicate categories of video viewership to ensure that a particular user is included in only one category. Additionally, note that in some embodiments, process 500 can store an indication that a user has disliked a video. In some such embodiments, process 500 can then remove any other indications related to the user and the video and can cause the user to not appear in a group of indicators of viewership. Furthermore, in some embodiments, process 500 can receive an indication that a user that has been tagged to view a video has removed the tag (e.g., by deleting their name from the tag, deleting a comment or post in which they were tagged, and/or in any other suitable manner), and in response, process 500 can remove and/or delete a stored indication that the user was tagged to view the video. Turning to FIG. 6 , an example 600 of a process for identifying, for a particular channel of media content and/or a particular video, a group of users to be included in a group of indicators of viewership of the particular channel of media content and/or video is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. Process 600 can begin by identifying a particular channel of media content and/or a particular video at 602 for which indicators of viewership are to be presented. Process 600 can identify the channel of media content and/or the video using any suitable technique(s) and based on any suitable information. For example, in some embodiments, the channel of media content and/or the video can be one included in a video service home page presented to a particular user authenticated with a corresponding user account. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, the channel of media content can include a channel that the user has subscribed to, a channel that is recommended for the user based on interests the user has indicated (e.g., in one or more posts on a social networking site, a profile associated with the user, and/or indicated in any other suitable manner), and/or any other suitable channels. As another more particular example, in some embodiments, the particular video can be one that is recommended for the user based on previously endorsed content, a video that has been determined to be a currently popular video (e.g., has received more than a predetermined number of views within a recent time period, and/or identified using any other suitable popularity metrics), and/or any other suitable video. Process 600 can identify a first group of users at 604 . The first group of users can include any suitable users, such as those that are associated with user accounts on a particular video sharing service, those that are associated with user accounts on a particular social networking service, and/or any other suitable users. In some embodiments, consent can be requested from users to be included in the first group of users, for example, as part of settings associated with a user account. At 606 , for each user in the first group of users, process 600 can determine an affinity score for the user and the channel of media content and/or the video. Process 600 can determine the affinity score based on any suitable information and using any suitable technique(s). For example, in some embodiments, the affinity score can be based on whether the user has viewed content produced by the channel of media content, has endorsed (e.g., indicated that they enjoyed) content produced by the channel of media content, has endorsed the video, has shared content produced by the channel of media content (e.g., in a social networking post), has shared the video (e.g., in a social networking post), has subscribed to the channel of media content, has commented on the video, and/or has interacted with the channel of media content or the video in any other suitable manner. In instances where the user has interacted with the channel of media content or the video in multiple instances (e.g., commented on the video and endorsed the video), process 600 can weigh the interactions in any suitable manner to calculate the affinity score based on the multiple interactions. For example, in some embodiments, endorsements can be weighed more heavily than viewing content, sharing content can be weighed more heavily than commenting on content, etc. Note that, in some embodiments, multiple affinity scores can be calculated for each of multiple types of interaction, and, in some such embodiments, each affinity score can be a Boolean value. For example, in some embodiments, an affinity score indicating whether the user has endorsed content associated with the channel of media content or the video can be a Boolean value, where a value of &#x201c;true&#x201d; indicates that the user has endorsed the content and a value of &#x201c;false&#x201d; indicates that the user has not endorsed the content. Process 600 can store the affinity score(s) in any suitable location, for example, in memory 304 of data server 202 . As a more particular example, in some embodiments, the affinity score(s) can be stored in a cache within memory 304 of data server 202 . In some such embodiments, the affinity score(s) can be stored in the cache for any suitable time period (e.g., a day, a week, a month, and/or any other suitable time period). Note that, in some embodiments, blocks 602 - 606 can be repeated for multiple channels of media content and/or videos, and the affinity scores for the multiple channels or videos and groups of users can be stored for later use, for example, on data server 202 . At 608 , process 600 can receive a request to present, to a user of a user device, groups of viewership indicators corresponding to the channel of media content or the video. Process 600 can receive the request based on any suitable action(s). For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can receive the request in response to a determination that the user has navigated to a particular page on the user device. As a more particular example, the page can include a home page corresponding to a user account of the user on a video sharing service or social networking service, a page corresponding to a particular channel of media content or a particular video (e.g., the channel of media content or the video described above in connection with block 602 ), and/or any other suitable page. Note that, in some embodiments, process 600 may not receive a request to present the group of viewership indicators. In some such embodiments, process 600 may identify the groups of viewership indicators and may store the identified groups of viewership indicators to be presented to the user at a later time. Process 600 can identify a second group of users connected to the user of the user device at 610 . As described above in connection with FIGS. 4 and 5 , each user in the second group of users can be connected to the user of the user device directly or indirectly. For example, in some embodiments, users who are directly connected may be direct connections on any suitable social networking service, have directly exchanged messages through any suitable communication interface (e.g., an instant messaging interface, e-mail, and/or any other suitable communication interface), and/or be directly connected in any other suitable manner. As another example, users who are indirectly connected may both belong to the same group on a social networking service, both be subscribed to the same channel of media content on a video sharing service, have a direct connection in common with both users, and/or be indirectly connected in any other suitable manner. Process 600 can identify the second group of users connected to the user of the user device using any suitable technique or combination of techniques. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can identify direct connections of the user on multiple networking platforms (e.g., one or more communication interfaces, social networking services, video sharing services, and/or any other suitable networking platforms). As another example, in some embodiments, process 600 can identify indirect connections and/or suggested connections by identifying groups the user of the user device belongs to, connections separated from the user of the user device by any suitable degree on a networking platform, and/or based on any other suitable information. Process 600 can determine a viewership status corresponding to the channel of media content or the video for each user in the second group of users at 612 . In some embodiments, the viewership status can indicate that the user belongs to a particular category. For example, in some embodiments, the categories can include users that have endorsed the channel of media content or video, users that have not watched content from the channel of media content or have not watched the video but are likely to enjoy the content, and users that do not belong to either of the previous categories. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the viewership status can include any other suitable categories, such as users that have been tagged by another user to view the content, users that have viewed the content but not endorsed the content, users that have shared the content on a social networking service, and/or any other suitable categories. In some embodiments, the categories can correspond to those shown in and described above in connection with panel 104 of FIG. 1 and blocks 404 - 412 of FIG. 4 . Note that, in some embodiments, the viewership status of a particular user corresponding to a particular channel of media content or particular video can be determined based on the user's interactions with the content that are publically available. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can determine the viewership status for each user and content combination based on interactions that occurred with the content while the user was signed in to a user account. In some embodiments, permission can be requested from the user to store and/or use any information relating to the user's interactions with content. At 614 , process 600 can identify a subset of the second group of users who are to be included in the group of viewership indicators based on the viewership status determined at block 612 . Process 600 can identify the subset using any suitable techniques. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can first determine a number of categories of viewership indicators to be presented (e.g., as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 ), and can then identify a subset of users corresponding to each of the categories. As a more particular example, in instances where process 600 determines that the categories are to include users who have endorsed the channel of media content or the video and users that would likely enjoy the channel of media content or video, process 600 can then identify, based on the viewership status, users corresponding to each of the two categories. In some embodiments, process 600 can identify any suitable number (e.g., one, two, five, ten, twenty, and/or any other suitable number) of users in each category. In instances where more users belong to each category than are to be indicated in the group of viewership indicators, process 600 can select the users in the subset based on any suitable criteria. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can select the users in the subset based on an affinity score and/or a score indicating a strength of a relationship between the user in the subset of users and the user to be presented with the viewership indicators. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can sort the users in the subset based on the strength of their relationship with the user to be presented with the viewership indicators, and can select the top N (e.g., one, two, five, ten, twenty, and/or any other suitable number) users in each category. In some embodiments, process 600 can use any suitable information and/or technique(s) to determine a strength of the relationship, for example, a number of interactions between the two users (e.g., number of messages sent, number of comments on posts on a social networking service, and/or any other suitable communication), a frequency of interaction, and/or any other suitable metric. In some embodiments, process 600 can cause the group of viewership indicators to be presented (e.g., as described above in connection with FIGS. 1 and 4 ) based on the identified subset of the second group of users. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, process 600 can store the identified subset of users for presentation on the user device at a later time. For example, in some embodiments, the subset of users can be identified and stored in a cache in memory 304 of data server 202 , and process 600 can cause the corresponding viewership indicators to be presented at a later time, for example, in response to a request from the user device (e.g., a request for a particular page, and/or any other suitable request). In instances where process 600 stored the identified subset of users, process 600 can verify the viewership status of each user in the subset of users and the connection status of each user in the subset of users to a user of the user device at 616 . For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can verify that users who were identified as having endorsed the channel of media content and/or the video have not retracted and/or modified their endorsement in the time since they were identified. As another example, in some embodiments, process 600 can verify that users who were identified as likely to enjoy the video have not viewed the video in the time since they were identified. As yet another example, in some embodiments, process 600 can verify that users who were identified as a direct connection of the user of the user device have not modified their connection status (e.g., retracted a friendship status on a social networking service, and/or modified a connection status in any other suitable manner) in the time since they were identified. In some embodiments, process 600 can loop back to block 602 and can identify a second channel of media content or a second video. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can loop through a list of channels and/or videos for which viewership indicators are to be created, and can store information relating to the viewership indicators (e.g., as described in blocks 606 and 612 ). The stored information can then be retrieved at any suitable later time, for example, in response to receiving a request to present a page on which the viewership indicators are to be presented. In some embodiments, at least some of the above described blocks of the processes of FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 can be executed or performed in any order or sequence not limited to the order and sequence shown in and described in connection with the figures. Also, some of the above blocks of FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 can be executed or performed substantially simultaneously where appropriate or in parallel to reduce latency and processing times. Additionally or alternatively, some of the above described blocks of the processes of FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 can be omitted. In some embodiments, any suitable computer readable media can be used for storing instructions for performing the functions and/or processes herein. For example, in some embodiments, computer readable media can be transitory or non-transitory. For example, non-transitory computer readable media can include media such as magnetic media (such as hard disks, floppy disks, and/or any other suitable magnetic media), optical media (such as compact discs, digital video discs, Blu-ray discs, and/or any other suitable optical media), semiconductor media (such as flash memory, electrically programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and/or any other suitable semiconductor media), any suitable media that is not fleeting or devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission, and/or any suitable tangible media. As another example, transitory computer readable media can include signals on networks, in wires, conductors, optical fibers, circuits, any suitable media that is fleeting and devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission, and/or any suitable intangible media. In situations in which the systems described herein collect personal information about users, or make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personal information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personal information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server. Accordingly, methods, systems, and media for indicating viewership of a video are provided. Although the invention has been described and illustrated in the foregoing illustrative embodiments, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made only by way of example, and that numerous changes in the details of implementation of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is limited only by the claims that follow. Features of the disclosed embodiments can be combined and rearranged in various ways.\"]"

       "['SECONDARY SYNCHRONIZATION CODEBOOK FOR E-UTRAN CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] The present Non-provisional Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Patent Application No. 60/955,623 filed on August 13, 2007 and entitled SECONDARY SYNCHRONIZATION CODEBOOK FOR E-UTRAN, assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND I. Field [0002] The following relates generally to wireless communication, and more specifically to determining a secondary synchronization codebook for selecting secondary synchronization codes for a radio network site. II. Background [0003] Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as, e.g., voice content, data content, and so on. Typical wireless communication systems can be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power). Examples of such multiple-access systems can include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like. [0004] Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems can simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations can be established via single-input singleoutput (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth. [0005] MIMO systems commonly employ multiple (Nr) transmit antennas and multiple (NR) receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by theNT transmit and NR receive antennas can be decomposed into Ns independent channels,   which can be referred to as spatial channels, where Ns <{N T ,N R ) . Each of the Ns independent channels corresponds to a dimension. Moreover, MIMO systems can provide improved performance (e.g., increased spectral efficiency, higher throughput and/or greater reliability) if additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and receive antennas are utilized. [0006] Improved performance, throughput and reliability provided by multitransmission wireless access sites can also introduce additional system complexities. For instance, where multiple base stations are transmitting within a common area, and such transmissions are received by a single device, a mechanism to distinguish between such transmissions can be required. Further, a means to distinguish and/or identify one base station from another can be required. One mechanism for identifying a base station(s) and distinguishing received transmissions is by employing channel synchronization. Synchronization can include, in some instances, a primary synchronization code (PSC) that includes frequency and timing information for a transmission, and a secondary synchronization code (SSC) that provides base station identity. In such instances, a device can distinguish and decode one or more transmissions in a multi-transmitter environment by way of the PSC and/or SSC. SUMMARY [0007] The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0040] Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It can be evident, however, that such aspect(s) can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects. [0041] In addition, various aspects of the disclosure are described below. It should be apparent that the teaching herein can be embodied in a wide variety of forms and that any specific structure and/or function disclosed herein is merely representative. Based on the teachings herein one skilled in the art should appreciate that an aspect disclosed herein can be implemented independently of any other aspects and that two or more of these aspects can be combined in various ways. For example, an apparatus can be implemented and/or a method practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, an apparatus can be implemented and/or a method practiced using other structure and/or functionality in addition to or other than one or more of the aspects set forth herein. As an example, many of the methods, devices, systems and apparatuses described herein are descried in the context of determining characteristics of one or more wireless channels and providing a handover determination based in part on magnitudes of the determined characteristics. One skilled in the art should appreciate that similar techniques could apply to other communication environments. [0042] The subject disclosure provides, in one or more aspects, reduced interference for multiple secondary synchronization code (SSC) transmission in a multitransmitter environment. The environment can be associated with a planned, semiplanned, and/or unplanned mobile communication environment. Typically, radio access network (RAN) base stations (BSs) employ synchronization codes to facilitate over the   air (OTA) communication with mobile devices (e.g., cellular telephones, cellularenabled laptops, multi-mode phones, personal digital assistants [PDAs], and/or the like). Mobile devices monitor the synchronization codes (and other portions of OTA transmissions in some instances) in order to determine when pertinent data is being provided by a BS. Where many BSs exist within a relatively small communication site (e.g., such that a mobile device receives wireless transmission from many BSs), the synchronization codes can interfere with each other, becoming difficult to distinguish at the mobile device. Accordingly, mechanisms to mitigate or avoid synchronization code interference can improve reliability of mobile communications. [0043] According to some aspects, particular mechanisms are provided to generate and scramble an SSC with a P-SCH related scrambling code. Scrambled SSCs can be less likely to interfere with each other when transmitted in a common mobile environment (e.g., a single mobile deployment site, or multiple closely positioned mobile sites). In at least one aspect, SSCs can be generated from a first set of sequences provided by a first mathematical expression, and scrambling codes to scramble the SSCs can be generated from a different mathematical expression. Further, sequence indexes of the scrambling codes can be selected based on a primary synchronization channel (P-SCH). Various mechanisms can be employed to generate the scrambled SSCs and reduce interference of multiple SSCs transmitted by multiple sources (e.g., BSs). [0044] SSCs can be generated from multiple sequences selected from a sequence matrix, comprising a base sequence and variations of the base sequence (e.g., cyclic shifted sequences). The base sequence, selected sequences and/or SSC can be scrambled with a scrambling code(s) to reduce interference of OTA SSCs. As one example, a pair of selected sequences can first be scrambled by the scrambling code(s), the sequences can then be combined to form a full-length scrambled SSC sequence (e.g., by interleaving the sequence pair), which can be mapped to an OTA message. In another example, the pair of sequences can first be interleaved to form an unscrambled full-length sequence and then scrambled by the scrambling code(s), then mapped to the transmission. In other examples, the base sequence can be scrambled such that the sequence matrix comprises the scrambled base sequence and scrambled variations thereof. In such example, a pair of scrambled sequences can be selected from the   matrix, interleaved to form a full-length SSC sequence, and mapped into the OTA message. The scrambled SSC sequences can yield reduced interference of transmittedSSCs and improve transmission reliability for planned, semi-planned or unplanned mobile base station deployment. [0045] According to one or more other aspects, a mechanism to generate PSCbased scrambling codes is provided that can randomize interference between encoded signals. Multiple sequences (e.g., three sequences) are employed to generate a scrambling code for one or more SSCs. The multiple sequences can comprise a set of full-length sequences (or, e.g., modified full-length sequences, such as one-bit truncated), or a set of half-length sequences appended to other half-length sequences of such a set. In at least one aspect, the set of full-length and/or half-length sequences are generated from a common M-sequence polynomial. In another aspect, the set of fulllength and/or half-length sequences can be generated from a plurality of M-sequence polynomials. In at least one additional aspect, PSC-based scrambling codes are created from three half-length M-sequences generated from a polynomial that is different from a polynomial utilized to generate an SSC. [0046] In accordance with one or more other aspects, provided is an SSC codebook for generating SSCs for a multi-transmitter mobile site. The SSCs can be generated from various sequences of a sequence matrix. The sequences can be selected based on PAPR and/or correlation determinations of SSCs that result from a pair of sequences. Thus, the resulting SSCs can exhibit improved transmission and reduced interference because of such aspects of the subject disclosure. [0047] As used in the subject disclosure, the terms \"component,\" \"system,\" and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, software, software in execution, firmware, middle ware, microcode, and/or any combination thereof. For example, a component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. One or more components can reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component can be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. Further, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components can communicate by way of local and/or remote processes such as in   accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal).Additionally, components of systems described herein can be rearranged and/or complemented by additional components in order to facilitate achieving the various aspects, goals, advantages, etc., described with regard thereto, and are not limited to the precise configurations set forth in a given figure, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. [0048] Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a mobile communication device (or, e.g., a mobile device). A mobile communication device can also be called a system, a subscriber unit, a subscriber station, mobile station, mobile, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, user agent, a user device, or user equipment. A subscriber station can be a cellular telephone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, or other processing device connected to a wireless modem or similar mechanism facilitating wireless communication with a processing device. [0049] In one or more exemplary embodiments, the functions described may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, middleware, microcode, or any suitable combination thereof. If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. A storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer.

Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. [0054] Referring now to the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates a wireless   communication system 100 with multiple base stations 110 and multiple terminals 120, such as can be utilized in conjunction with one or more aspects. A base station ( 110) is generally a fixed station that communicates with the terminals and can also be called an access point, a Node B, or some other terminology. Each base station 110 provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area or coverage area, illustrated as three geographic areas in Fig. 1, labeled 102a, 102b, and 102c. The term \"cell\" canrefer to a base station and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. To improve system capacity, a base station geographic area/coverage area can be partitioned into multiple smaller areas (e.g. , three smaller areas, according to cell 102a in Fig. 1), 104a, 104b, and 104c. Each smaller area (104a, 104b, 104c) can be served by a respective base transceiver subsystem (BTS). The term \"sector\" can refer to a BTS and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. For a sectorized cell, the BTSs for all sectors of that cell are typically co-located within the base station for the cell. The transmission techniques described herein can be used for a system with sectorized cells as well as a system with un-sectorized cells. For simplicity, in the following description, unless specified otherwise, the term \"base station\" is used generically for a fixed station that serves a sector as well as a fixed station that serves a cell. [0055] Terminals 120 are typically dispersed throughout the system, and each terminal can be fixed or mobile. A terminal can also be called a mobile station, user equipment, a user device, or some other terminology. A terminal can be a wireless device, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem card, and so on. Each terminal 120 can communicate with zero, one, or multiple base stations on the downlink and uplink at any given moment. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. [0056] For a centralized architecture, a system controller 130 couples to base stations 110 and provides coordination and control for base stations 110. For a distributed architecture, base stations 110 can communicate with one another as needed. Data transmission on the forward link often occurs from one access point to one access terminal at or near the maximum data rate that can be supported by the forward link and/or the communication system. Additional channels of the forward link (e.g., control   channel) can be transmitted from multiple access points to one access terminal. Reverse link data communication can occur from one access terminal to one or more access points. [0057] Fig. 2 is an illustration of an ad hoc or unplanned/semi-planned wireless communication environment 200, in accordance with various aspects. System 200 can comprise one or more base stations 202 in one or more cells and/or sectors that receive, transmit, repeat, etc., wireless communication signals to each other and/or to one ormore mobile devices 204. As illustrated, each base station 202 can provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area, illustrated as four geographic areas, labeled 206a, 206b, 206c and 206d. Each base station 202 can comprise a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, and so forth.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. Mobile devices 204 can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless network 200. System 200 can be employed in conjunction with various aspects described herein in order to facilitate providing and/or utilizing synchronized OTA message transmission in a wireless communication environment (200), as set forth herein with regard to subsequent figures. [0058] Fig. 3 is a block diagram of an example system 300 that provides reduced interference for synchronization messages in a mobile communication environment. A synchronization message as utilized in the context of system 300 can include an SSC. It should also be appreciated that aspects of a primary synchronization code (PSC), or of a P-SCH, can be employed to reduce interference of an SSC, as discussed herein. It should be further appreciated that a mobile communication environment pertinent to system 300 can include a third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), referred hereinafter collectively as LTE, system, an evolved universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) terrestrial radio access network (E-UTRAN) system, or a combination thereof or of the like. For instance, other suitable mobile communication architectures employing orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) access technology, frequency division multiplexing   (FDM), including e.g., orthogonal FDM (OFDM), coded OFDM (COFDM), and/or the like, are included in such a mobile communication environment. It should further be appreciated that one of skill in the art may determine appropriate mechanisms to apply the below techniques to other mobile communication environments, including code division multiple access (CDMA) environments (e.g., CDMA2000, 3GPP2, etc.), time division multiple access (TDMA) environments (e.g., TDMA), time division duplex (TDD) environments, or suitable combinations thereof (e.g. , TD-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, UMTS-TDD, FDMA/TDMA/FDD, etc.).[0059] System 300 can comprise an SSC generator 302 coupled to one or more base stations of a RAN 306 (e.g., an E-UTRAN). One or more devices 304 can be serviced by the RAN 306. The base stations (306) can communicate with the mobile device 304 by exchanging OTA messages there with. An OTA message sent to the mobile device(s) 304 typically include one or more synchronization messages to facilitate such communication. For instance, a PSC can be utilized to indicate where data is packed in the message, message length, synchronization frequency, or the like. An SSC can provide the prior information, as well as an identity of a transmitting base station 306. Thus, the SSC can be utilized by the mobile device 304 to distinguish one base station (306) from another (306) in a multi-transmitter site 306. [0060] Where multiple OTA messages are transmitted by multiple base stations, at substantially concurrent times, interference between the messages can result. Interference with respect to synchronization information can lead to missed messages, increased power consumption at mobile device 304, and communication inefficiency. To mitigate occurrence of interference, SSC generator 302 can employ one or more scrambling codes to reduce likelihood that two SSCs will interfere with each other at a receiving device (304). [0061] System 300 can further comprise a logic processor 308 that generates a sequence matrix utilized to create one or more SSCs for base stations of the RAN 306. For instance, a sequence, sequence pair, sequence triplet, etc. , can be utilized to generate an SSC. In one aspect, pairs of length-31 sequences (e.g., binary sequences having 3 1 binary bits) are employed to generate 62 bit SSCs. The sequence pairs can be selected from the sequence matrix generated by logic processor 308. In one example, the sequence matrix can be generated from a single base M-sequence of length-3 1. Such a   sequence can be derived from a suitable polynomial expression. In other aspects, logic processor 308 derives the base M-sequence from a different polynomial expression than that used by a data transformation module 310 (below) to generate sequences for SSC scrambling codes. As a particular example, the polynomial expression utilized to generate the base M-sequence can be of the form xL5 + xL2 + 1 over GF(2), where GF(2) indicates a Galois Field that limits results of the expression to binary digits. [0062] Once a base sequence is generated by the logic processor 308, variations of the base sequence can be formed to populate the sequence matrix. In some aspects, a number of variations are generated that is substantially equivalent to a number of digitsof the base sequence. {E.g., if the base sequence comprises 3 1 digits, 29, 30, 31, or substantially similar number of variations are generated). The variations are combined with the base sequence to form the sequence matrix {e.g., where the first, second, third, etc., rows of the matrix comprise the base sequence, first variation, second variation, etc., respectively, and where the first, second, third, etc., columns of the matrix comprise the first, second, third, etc., digits of each sequence, respectively - e.g., see Fig. 4, supra). [0063] Once the sequence matrix is defined, logic processor can select multiple sequences from the matrix that can be utilized to generate an SSC. As one example, a pair of length-31 sequences can be selected to form a length-62 SSC. Each such SSC can then be assigned to one or more base stations of the RAN 306, and can carry identifying information {e.g., base station ID) distinguishing such base stations from other base stations. As discussed in more detail at Figs. 5 and 6, infra, the selection can be based on multiple factors, including, but not limited to, PAPR of a resulting SSC, or signal correlation, or a combination thereof or of the like. To reduce interference between SSCs transmitted by RAN 306, the SSCs can be scrambled by employing one or more scrambling sequences, such as a PSC-bases sequence, discussed below. [0064] System 300 can further comprise a data transformation module 310 that scrambles at least one sequence of a sequence matrix with a common binary scrambling code. In at least one aspect, the scrambling code can be generated by a sequence module 312 that employs sequences derived from a common polynomial expression. The common polynomial expression and/or derived sequences can be based on a PSC associated with wireless communication {e.g., OTA message). As an example, indices   derived from the PSC can be employed to select sequence pairs, sequence triplets, or the like {e.g., from a scrambling code sequence matrix), to generate the scrambling code. Selection of scrambling code sequences based on the PSC can provide reduced interference for OTA transmission of multiple SSCs. [0065] It should be appreciated that the data transformation module 310 can employ the scrambling sequence to scramble a multiplexed SSC, components of an SSC {e.g., sequences of a sequence pair, triplet, etc., that form the SSC), or sequences of the sequence matrix itself. In one particular example, data transformation module 310 can scramble a base sequence utilized to generate a sequence matrix. Derivative sequences of the scrambled base sequence {e.g., cyclic shifted variations) utilized to form thesequence matrix are inherently scrambled as well. Accordingly, a sequence matrix can be formed of scrambled sequences (e.g. , by employing the scrambled base sequence or variations thereof), unscrambled sequences (e.g., by employing the unscrambled base sequence and variations thereof), or both. A matrix of scrambled sequences can be selected by logic processor 308, interleaved by multiplexing module 314, and mapped to an OTA message by transmission processor 316, as discussed in more detail below. [0066] In other examples, a scrambling code can be applied to one or more nonscrambled sequences selected from an unscrambled sequence matrix. For instance, data transformation module 310 can scramble multiple short sequences selected from such a matrix that are then interleaved by a multiplexing module 314 to form a full-length SSC sequence. As another example, multiplexing module 314 can interleave the short sequences first, and then provide the resulting full-length sequence to the data transformation module 312, which scrambles the full-length sequence. The scrambled sequence is then utilized as an SSC for one or more base stations (306). [0067] Various types of scrambling codes, as known in the art or made known to one of skill in the art by way of the context provided herein, can be generated by sequence module 312. As mentioned above, sequence module 312 can generate various sequences (e.g., M-sequences) from a common polynomial expression, or different polynomial expressions. In at least one aspect, three length-63 M-sequence based scrambling codes are generated, where each length-63 sequence is truncated by one bit to form a scrambling code (or, e.g., one bit is changed to 0 and mapped to a DC tone of a wireless transmission). In another example, three length-31 M-sequence based   scrambling codes are generated, and repetition is employed to generate three length-62 scrambling codes (e.g., where B is a length-31 sequence, repetition can be of the form [B, B]). [0068] In at least one particular aspect, each of multiple scrambling code sequences can be formed from a single polynomial expression. In one aspect, the polynomial expression can be of the form l+x L2+xL3+xL4+xL5. A resulting scrambling code sequence can be represented by C(0,n). As a specific example of a suitable scrambling sequence, C(0,n) can denote the following M-sequence: C(0,n) = (-1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1, -1,-1,1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,IjThe above sequence C(0,n) can represent a base M-sequence. Cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence (e.g., see Fig. 4, infra) can be defined as C(k,n) = C(0,(n+k) mod N). Accordingly, length-63 scrambling codes can be obtained as: [C(u,0),C(u,0),...,C(u,14),C(u,14),C(u,15),0,C(u,15),C (u,16),C(u,16),...,C(u,30),C(u,30 )] where 0 can be mapped to a DC tone of a frequency-based transmission. It should be appreciated that other length codes can be generated by setting suitable values for k and n for C(k,n) (e.g., k and n can have suitable values greater than 0). For the length-63 case, distinct scrambling codes can be generated by selecting distinct values of V . Values of V can be selected based on a desired number of scrambling code sequences for a set of such sequences. For instance, five, ten, twenty, etc., variations of the base M-sequence can be selected. For 31 possible sequences, \\'u\\' can correspond to the set {0, . .., 30}. [0069] In at least one aspect, sequence module 312 can generate three scrambling sequences from the formula C(k,n) = C(O,(n+k) mod N). The scrambling codes can correspond to the following three values of V : {0, 10, 20}, thus utilizing the base M-sequence, a tenth cyclic shifted variation of the base sequence, and a twentieth cyclic shifted variation of the base sequence. The resulting three scrambling code sequences are: C(0,n) = {-1,1, 1,1,-1,-1,-1, 1,-1, 1,-1, 1,1,-1, 1,-1,-1,-1,-1, 1,1,-1,-1, 1,-1,-1, 1,1, 1,1,1} C(10,n) = {-1,1,1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1, -1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1} C(20,n) = { 1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1, -1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1} [0070] The foregoing scrambling sequences can be employed to generate   scrambling codes of varying length (e.g., length-62 scrambling code) and combined with SSC sequences. Scrambled sequences are mapped into wireless transmissions, as discussed below. By employing scrambling sequences of a common polynomial expression, a significant reduction in interference among transmitted SSCs can be accomplished [0071] System 300 can further comprise a transmission processor 316. The transmission processor 316 can map an SSC onto components of an OTA message.Specifically, the SSC can be mapped onto sub-carrier channels of a frequency based message (e.g., FDM, OFDM, OFDMA), onto code divisions of a code based message (e.g., CDMA, CDMA-2000, wideband CDMA [WCDMA]), onto time divisions of a time based message (e.g., TDMA), or suitable sub-components of combined system messages (e.g., TD-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, UMTS-TDD, FDMA/TDMA/FDD, etc.). The OTA message can be received at mobile device 304, which can employ suitable techniques for decoding the message and the SSC. In at least one instance, the mobile device 304 can employ a substantially inverse process for decoding the SSC as SSC generator 302 employs for coding/scrambling the SSC. Instructions for decoding the SSC can be pre-loaded onto the mobile device 302, downloaded from a network patch or the like (e.g., a software and/or firmware patch at a service provider\\'s network server), or included within the OTA message (e.g., in a message preamble, or the like). [0072] As described, system 300 can provide substantial benefit for wireless communications. SSC scrambling codes generated from a common polynomial expression and indexed based on a corresponding PSC can result in reduced interference for SSCs transmitted by multiple base stations (306). Such a result can be of even greater benefit where large numbers of base stations (306) exist in a semi-planned or un planned deployment, where interference can be high and signal to noise ratios (SNR) relatively low. Accordingly, system 300 can provide for increased efficiency and OTA reliability even for unfavorable wireless environments. [0073] Fig. 4 illustrates an example sequence matrix 400 that can be utilized to generate synchronization codes and/or scrambling codes for various aspects described herein. Sequence matrix 400 comprises a number of sequences represented by rows of the matrix 400. The first (top) row of the matrix is a base sequence. Lower rows of the matrix are variations of the base sequence. As depicted in Fig. 4, the lower rows are   cyclic shifted variations of the base sequence, although it should be appreciated that other suitable variations of a binary base sequence, known in the art, can be utilized to generate a similar sequence matrix to that depicted at 400. As depicted by the arrows in shown amongst the sequence matrix 400, the cyclic shift is a single digit shift whereby variations of the base sequence are formed by shifting each sequence bit one position, or one matrix column, as compared to a previous sequence. Thus, bit 1 for the base sequence is -1, and a first cyclic shifted variation of the base sequence, depicted at row 2 of the matrix, has the same - 1 in the second bit (second column). Further, each bit ofthe base sequence is shifted into the next right-most column in the first cyclic shifted sequence. It should be appreciated that multiple cyclic shifts can be employed instead, such that each bit is shifted two columns, three columns, etc., with respect to previous sequences instead of a single column. [0074] Additional rows of the matrix exhibit further shifts of the base sequence. Thus, bits of the second cyclic shifted sequence (row 3) are shifted two columns from the base sequence (row 1), and so on, throughout each row. For a matrix having \\'L\\' columns, based on sequence lengths of \\'L\\', the matrix can comprise at least \\'L\\' unique sequences, including the base sequence and L-I single cyclic shifted variations of the base sequence. Such a sequence can be employed to generate synchronization codes and/or scrambling codes as described herein. Where \\'L\\' matches a desired code length, single sequences of the matrix 400 can be employed to create such codes. Alternatively, where \\'L\\' is shorter than the desired code length, multiple sequences of the matrix 400 can be employed to create the code(s). [0075] As an example to illustrate the foregoing, a desired code length {e.g., SSC length) is 62 bits. Where \\'L\\' is equal to 62, a single sequence of the matrix 400 can be utilized to form a code. Where \\'L\\' is equal to 31, sequence pairs of the matrix 400 can be interleaved to from the code. Where \\'L\\' is equal to 2 1, a sequence triplet, with one of the sequences truncated by one bit, can be interleaved to generate the code. It should also be appreciated that substantially similar sequence lengths can be employed in conjunction with bit truncation and/or bit repetition {e.g., a length-63 Msequence can be truncated by one bit to form the length-62 code, also length-30 or length-32 sequence pairs can be employed in conjunction with single bit repetition or truncation, respectively, to form the length-62 code, etc.).   [0076] For dense base station deployment, where dozens or hundreds of base stations operate at a common geographic site {e.g., see Fig. 1, supra), employing pairs, triplets, etc., of sequences of shorter length than a target code length can be beneficial. This is due to the fact that many more unique sequence pairs, triplets, etc., can be extracted from the sequence matrix 400 than single sequences. For instance, if \\'L\\' is equal to 62, and a desired SSC length is 62 bits, 62 unique single sequences exist to form 62 distinct SSCs. However, where matrix 400 has \\'L\\' = 31, and for a length-62 SSC, there are 961 (31L2) sequence pairs that can form 961 different SSCs. As another example, for \\'L=20\\' or \\'L=21 \\' (employing bit repetition or truncation) there are 8,000or 9261, respectively, sequence triplet combinations that can generate different SSCs. Accordingly, by selecting an appropriate sequence length with respect to a desired SSC length, and employing pairs, triplets, etc., of sequences, a number of unique codes generated by a matrix (400) can be increased. [0077] In at least one specific example of the claimed subject matter, matrix 400 is a square matrix having 3 1 M-sequences of length \\'L\\' equal to 31. The base sequence is a binary sequence generated from a polynomial expression of the form xL5 + xL2 + 1 over GF(2). Further, the additional sequences are single cyclic shifted variations of the base sequence {e.g., as depicted by the arrows of the sequence matrix 400). Pairs of sequences can be selected and interleaved to form various distinct SSC codes. As described elsewhere herein, SSC scrambling can be implemented in various ways {e.g., see Fig. 3, supra). In one example, the selected pairs can be interleaved to form length- 62 sequences and then scrambled. Alternatively, the selected length-3 1 sequences can be scrambled and then interleaved to form the length-62 sequence. As yet another alternative, the base M-sequence can be scrambled, such that each cyclic shifted variation of the matrix 400 is also scrambled. Scrambled sequence pairs can then be selected and interleaved to form the length-62 SSC code. Optionally, a 0 bit can be added to the length-62 codes to form length-63 codes, where the 0 bit is mapped to a DC tone of a wireless transmission. Thus, a variety of mechanisms can be employed to reduce interference of overlapping wireless messages received at a device, providing improved reception and overall communication, as well as potentially reducing power at the receiving device {e.g., by avoiding repeat transmission). [0078] Fig. 5 depicts a block diagram of an example system 500 that provides   reduced interference for transmitted SSCs in a multi-transmitter mobile site. More specifically, system 500 provides a selective codebook for choosing sequence combinations for generating resulting SSCs. In some aspects, the sequence combinations can be based on underlying characteristics of a resulting SSC. Accordingly, improved wireless transmission can be accomplished by properly selecting SSCs that yield desirable traits in a mobile communication environment. [0079] System 500 includes an SSC index selector 502 that identifies a sequence or group of sequences {e.g., sequence pair) for generating one or more SSCs that can be assigned to a base station 504 of a RAN (not depicted, but see Fig. 3, at 306). The SSC index selector 502 can comprise a logic processor 506 that forms a sequence matrixfrom which the sequence or group of sequences can be selected. The sequence matrix can be formed utilizing a base sequence and a number of variations of the base sequence. In at least one aspect, the base sequence is a binary M-sequence of length n+1, and the matrix comprises the base sequence and n cyclic shifted variations of the base sequence (e.g., as depicted at Fig. 4, supra). An indexing module 508 can assign indices to sequences and/or groups of sequences of the sequence matrix. Sequences /groups of sequences can be selected by reference to an assigned index. In at least one aspect of the subject disclosure, the index module assigns substantially (n+1) indices, where x is a number of sequences in a group. Thus, for single sequences, substantially n+1 indices are assigned. For sequence pairs, substantially (n+l) L2 indices are assigned, and so on. [0080] Where more distinct SSC sequence combinations exist than base stations (504) requiring an SSC, a pruning module 510 can select sequences/sequence groups based on characteristics of a resulting SSC. The characteristics can be based on results of a signal emulator, for instance, that can determine interference, power loss, crosscorrelation, and like characteristics of an SSC. Sequences/sequence groups yielding SSCs with desirable characteristics, such as low PAPR, can be selected to generate SSCs. [0081] As a particular example to illustrate aspects of system 500, logic processor 506 defines a sequence matrix having 3 1 length-31 sequences. Sequence pairs of the matrix can be represented by (u, v), where u and v both have values {0, . .., 30} . A number of length-62 SSCs can be generated based on the sequence pairs (u,v) of   the sequence matrix. Indexing module 508 assigns (n+l) L2, or 961, indices to the 961 distinct sequence pairs of the sequence matrix. An algorithm of the form r = u*3 1+v can be used to generate these indices. In one aspect of the example, pruning module 510 selects 170 of the 961 distinct indices based on characteristics of SSC signals comprised of the sequence pairs (e.g., including scrambling, such as provided by a common PSC-based scrambling code, and interleaving the sequences). One or more of the selected SSCs (e.g., a pair), can then be modulated by a transmission processor 512 (e.g., employing a modulator, signal coder, etc.) into a radio frame to resolve a frame boundary of the radio frame. As one particular aspect of the example, the following SSC indices r = u*31+v corresponding to a maximum PAPR of substantially 6.75 decibels (dB) can be employed:16 18 2 0 33 62 63 66 70 7 1 75 80 83 9 3 99 104 105 113 116 121 125 126 140 153 168 169 170 173 189 190 191 203 204 210 211 220 226 228 233 236 241 251 261 267 268 270 278 287 293 300 304 313 317 327 332 336 338 339 344 346 355 367 377 379 388 395 399 401 417 418 419 422 424 426 435 439 445 452 453 456 457 466 475 478 482 486 488 493 498 508 515 516 517 518 531 533 534 543 546 553 554 560 565 587 589 592 606 614 618 621 623 625 628 631 636 645 653 665 677 678 684 700 707 708 711 713 714 719 725 728 735 738 745 751 752 755 765 770 777 781 789 797 801 802 810 816 818 819 826 829 831 851 854 856 862 863 871 879 889 897 901 909 910 913 916 917 930 938 940 946 954 [0082] In another aspect o f the example, pruning module 510 selects 340 o f the 961 distinct indices, also based on characteristics o f SSC signals comprised o f the selected sequence pairs. Different tones derived from one or more o f 340 resulting SSCs (e.g., different tones o f a pair o f SSCs) can b e modulated by transmission processor 512 into the radio frame to resolve the frame boundary o f the radio frame. In one specific aspect, the following SSC indices r = u*31+v can b e employed that   correspond to a maximum PAPR o f substantially 7.18dB: 2 5 6 7 1 1 14 17 18 2 0 2 3 2 7 30 33 37 39 4 1 4 3 44 4 7 50 53 60 6 1 63 65 66 6 8 70 7 1 74 75 80 84 86 8 99 101 102 104 105 107 111 113 114 115 116 121 125 126 137 140 144 151 153 155 158 168 169 170 173 183 187 189 190 191 197 203 204 205 209 210 211 212 217 219 220 225 226 227 228 233 236 238 240 241 257 259 261 263 266 267 268 270 271 276 277 278 285 286 290 292 293 294 300 303 304 306 307 310 311 312 313 316 317 327 331 332 336 338 339 341 342 344 346 347 353 359 360 362 363 365 372 373 374 377 379 382 383 388 394 399 401 406 413 417 418 419 420 421 422 424 426 430 439 442 445 446 450 452 453 454 456 457 463 466 475 478 482 483 485 486 492 493 494 495 498 499 505 506 508 513 515 516 517 518 519 527 528 531 533 534 539 543 549 550 553 554 560 565 569 570 571 572 573 579 583 587 588 589 590 592 594 596 603 606 607 609 610 614 620 621 625 630 631 634 636 637 642 645 646 653 657 659 661 664 668 675 677 678 679 681 682 684 686 690 694 699 700 702 707 708 709 720 725 726 728 732 733 735 738 739 740 741 747 751 752 753 755 760 764 767 770 772 773 780 781 782 785 787 789 791 795 797 801 802 805 810 811 815 818 819 821 823 825 826 830 831 838 842 845 846 851 853 854 856 862 863 868 871 875 876 878 879 881 889 891 892 897 901 906 907 909 910 913 916 917 918 919 925 930 935 936 940 942 943 944 951 954 957 959[0083] In yet another example for selecting code indices, 170, 340, or another suitable number of indices can be selected based on minimizing a number of   overlapping code indices used in a single SSC. For example, a first set of length-31 sequences V can employ indices {0, 1, 2, . .., 19}. A second set of length-3 1 sequences V can employ indices { 1 1, 13, 14, . .., 30} such that overlap between V and V sequences of resulting SSCs are minimized. Reduced index overlap can, in some instances, provide reduced interference between transmitted codes. [0084] As described, system 500 can provide an SSC codebook that selects SSCs based on underlying characteristics of the transmitted synchronization signal. Such a result can lead to improved signal reception for terminal devices in a mobile environment, a decrease in repetitive traffic (e.g., fewer data retransmission requests), and lower power consumption for such terminals. Accordingly, substantial benefits can be provided by system 500 for a mobile communication environment. [0085] Fig. 6 illustrates a block diagram of an example system 600 that employs an SSC codebook as described herein for reducing interference between SSC transmissions. Selection of SSC codes can be based on comparison of transmission power and/or cross-correlation characteristics of a simulated SSC and one or more thresholds. Resulting SSC(s) can be modulated into a wireless transmission (e.g., a radio frame) to resolve a frame boundary of the transmission. Because SSC selection is based on underlying SSC characteristics, improved power and/or correlation characteristics can be provided by system 600 for mobile communications. [0086] System 600 comprises an SSC index selector 602 that indexes sequences or groups of sequences of a sequence matrix. The index selector can select one or more indices based on power and/or cross-correlation characteristics of a simulated SSC code 604 that results from a particular sequence(s) identified by an index. Determined power and/or cross-correlation characteristics can be qualified based on comparison to one or more thresholds. For instance, pruning module 606 can condition selection of a particular index based on comparison of SSC PAPR to a PAPR threshold (e.g., based on a nominal OFDM symbol), comparison of SSC cross-correlation to a cross-correlation threshold, or both. Thus, resulting SSCs can be generated that have predetermined quality characteristics. [0087] System 600 can employ a signal simulation module 608 to determine PAPR of simulated SSCs (604) resulting from a sequence(s) identified by a particularindex. Signal simulation module 608 can compare the determined PAPR to a threshold   PAPR, and forward the results to pruning module 606. A relatively low PAPR is typically beneficial (e.g., as compared with transmission of typical frequency-modulated signals) for wireless transmission, resulting in negligible impact on downlink transmissions in many instances. Thus, the threshold can typically specify some maximum acceptable PAPR, an acceptable range within a desired PAPR (e.g. , within 3dB of the desired PAPR), a number of SSCs below the desired PAPR (e.g., 30 SSCs having PAPR values below the desired PAPR), or the like, or a suitable combination thereof. [0088] System 600 can also employ a signal correlation module 610 that determines a cross-correlation factor of simulated SSCs (604) resulting from a sequence(s) identified by a particular index. Signal correlation module 610 can compare a determined cross-correlation to a cross-correlation threshold to qualify the simulated SSC 604. Signals strongly correlated with other signals can often exhibit high interference, thus minimal cross-correlation can be desired. Accordingly, pruning module 606 can condition selection of a particular sequence index based at least in part on cross-correlation being equal or lower than the threshold correlation. In some aspects, pruning module 606 can condition selection of a particular sequence index on a combination of PAPR results and cross-correlation results. For instance, if a simulated SSC (604) has a PAPR lower than a threshold PAPR and correlation lower than a correlation threshold, an index associated with the simulated SSC (604) can be selected. As described, system 600 provides a convenient mechanism for selecting indices of a sequence matrix in order to provide beneficial PAPR and/or low cross-correlation characteristics, resulting in improved wireless transmission and reliability in many instances. [0089] Fig. 7 depicts a block diagram of an example system 700 comprising a base station 702 and one or more mobile devices 704 according to aspects of the subject disclosure. In at least one aspect of the subject disclosure, base station 702 can determine suitable SSC codes and/or scrambling codes to reduce interference of transmitted synchronization information. Specifically, various mechanisms for generating and scrambling SSCs, generating scrambling codes (e.g., based on three length-31 M-sequences) for such SSCs, and selecting sequence indices based on   characteristics of such SSCs can be accomplished by base station 702. Accordingly,system 700 facilitates improved mobile communication by providing improved transmission characteristics for OTA messages received at one or more mobile devices 704 in a mobile communication environment. [0090] System 700 comprises a base station 702 (e.g., access point, . ..) with a receiver 710 that receives signal(s) from one or more mobile devices 704 through a plurality of receive antennas 706, and a transmitter 728 that transmits to the one or more mobile devices 704 through a transmit antenna(s) 708. Receiver 710 can receive information from receive antennas 706 and can further comprise a signal recipient (not shown) that receives uplink data synchronized in accordance with a PSC and/or SSC provided by base station 702. Additionally, receiver 710 is operatively associated with a demodulator 712 that demodulates received information. Demodulated symbols are analyzed by a processor 714 that is coupled to a memory 716 that stores information related to generating a sequence matrix to provide synchronization and/or scrambling codes, as well as selecting, scrambling and/or multiplexing such sequences to form the SSCs, selecting sequences according to an SSC codebook as described herein, known in the art or made known to one of skill in the art by way of the context provided herein, and/or any other suitable information related to performing the various actions and functions set forth herein. [0091] Processor 714 is further coupled to a logic processor 718 that can generate a sequence matrix from at least a base M-sequence and cyclic shifted variations of such sequence (e.g., n cyclic shifted variations). The processor 714 can be further coupled to a data transformation module 720 that can scramble various sequences of the sequence matrix provided by the logic processor 718. For instance, the data transformation module 720 can employ a common binary scrambling code based on a PSC associated with a wireless communication to scramble at least one such sequence pertinent to an SSC, as described herein. [0092] Additionally, the processor 714 can be coupled to a multiplexing module 722 that can generate an SSC based on at least one scrambled sequence provided by the data transformation module 720. For instance, where the data transformation module 720 scrambles a base sequence of a sequence matrix, any suitable cyclic shifted variation of the scrambled base sequence, and/or the scrambled base sequence itself, can   be utilized by the multiplexing module 722 to form the SSC. The SSC can be formedby interleaving two or more sequences, repetition of one or more sequences, addition/truncation of bits, or the like, as required. [0093] Processor 714 can further be associated with a sequence module 724. Sequence module 724 can generate the scrambling code from one or more sequences provided by the logic processor 718 (e.g., based on a common polynomial expression that is different from an expression used to generate SSC-related sequences). In one example, the sequence module 724 can generate three suitable M-sequences, either length-63 or length-31, to form the scrambling code(s). The three M-sequences can be generated from a base M-sequence and cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence, for example. Further, in at least some aspects, at least 20 cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence can be created, and the three M-sequences can comprise the base Msequence, a tenth cyclic shifted variation, and a twentieth cyclic-shifted variation. It should be appreciated, however, that other variations of the base sequence can be employed, and other selected members of the set of variations can be utilized for the three (or, e.g., other suitable number) of scrambling code sequences. [0094] Base station 702 can further comprise a modulator 726 that can map an SSC to an OTA message transmitted by transmitter 728. In one aspect, the SSC can be mapped onto some or all sub-carrier channels of an OFDM transmission. The OTA message can be sent via the transmission antennas 708 to mobile device 704. It should be appreciated that base station 702 can be part of a planned, semi-planned or unplanned deployment of several base stations (not depicted) operating in a common area. Generation, scrambling and assignment of SSCs can be implemented by base station 702 in a predetermined manner specified by logic processor 718, and sequence module 724, or other instructions stored in memory 716 and executed by processor 714 pertinent to multi-base station operation. In the alternative, base station 702 can communicate with other nearby base stations over a backhaul network (not depicted) to coordinate assignment of SSCs to various base stations of a cell site. In at least one other alternative, code assignments can be specified at least in part by a centralized entity (not depicted, but see Fig. 3, supra) and provided to base station 702. Accordingly, system 700 can function as part of a RAN comprising multiple base stations.   [0095] Fig. 8 illustrates a block diagram of an example system 800 that comprises a mobile device 802. Mobile device 802 can be configured to receive anddecode synchronization information within an OTA message transmitted by a base station 804. Decoding processes at the mobile device 802 can be inverse to similar processes employed by the base station 804. Instructions for receiving and decoding the message can be pre-loaded at the mobile device 802, included at least in part within the OTA message, obtained by way of a software/firmware patch (e.g., over a network, or connection to a computing device), or a combination thereof or of the like. [0096] Mobile handset 802 includes at least one antenna 806 (e.g., a transmission receiver or group of such receivers comprising an input interface) that receives a signal (e.g. , comprising synchronization information pertinent to facilitating remote wireless communication) and a receiver 808, which performs typical actions (e.g., filters, amplifies, down-converts, etc.) on the received signal. Specifically, antenna 806 and transmitter 830 (collectively referred to as a transceiver) can be configured to facilitate wireless data exchange with base station 804. [0097] Antenna 806 and receiver 808 can also be coupled with a demodulator 810 that can demodulate received symbols and provide them to a processor 812 for evaluation. Specifically, demodulator 810 can extract at least synchronization information from received wireless transmissions. For frequency-based transmission, for instance, the demodulator 810 can extract the synchronization information from subcarrier frequencies of the wireless transmissions. In one aspect, the synchronization information can comprise at least an SSC further comprised of at least two sequences scrambled with a common PSC-based binary scrambling code. A signal processor 814 can employ a common PSC-based binary descrambling code to decipher the at least two sequences comprising the received SSC. The descrambling code can be substantially equivalent to the scrambling code employed by the base station 804, or can be a counterpart thereof (e.g., an inverted scrambling code). In at least one aspect, decoding the synchronization information involves a data processor 820 that applies a first reverse cyclic shift to a first of the two sequences associated with the SSC and a second reverse cyclic shift to a second of the two sequences. In such aspect(s), the signal processor 814 can then apply the descrambling code to the shifted first sequence and shifted second sequence to decipher the SSC.   [0098] Once the received SSC is decoded, a logic processor 818 can extract identification information pertinent to a device (804) that transmitted the received data.Such information can be utilized to further decode received data (e.g. , payload information) and/or facilitate communication with the transmitting device (804). [0099] It should be appreciated that processor 812 can control and/or reference one or more components (806, 808, 810, 816, 822) of the mobile handset 802. Further, processor 812 can execute one or more modules, applications, engines, or the like (814, 818, 820) that comprise information or controls pertinent to executing functions of the mobile device 802. For instance, such functions can include receiving data from a remote source (804), decoding the received data based on a particular descrambling code, identifying a mobile network transmitter (804) associated with the deciphered code, or the like, as described above. [00100] Mobile handset 802 can additionally include memory 816 that is operatively coupled to processor 812. Memory 816 can store data to be transmitted, received, and the like. Further, memory 816 can store the modules, applications, engines, etc. (814, 818, 820) executed by processor 812, above. [00101] Mobile handset 802 can still further comprise a modulator 822, and a transmitter 824 that transmits generated signals (e.g., by processor 812 and modulator 822) to, for instance, base station 804, an access point, another access terminal, a remote agent, etc. As described, system 800 provides a mobile device 802 that can facilitate receiving coded synchronization information provided by a base station 804 and decipher the coded information to facilitate wireless communication between such devices (802, 804). Because the synchronization information can be encoded based on a selected SSC codebook and/or based on certain scrambling codes, reduced interference and improved reliability and reduced power consumption at the mobile device 802 can potentially be accomplished. [00102] The aforementioned systems have been described with respect to interaction between several components, modules and/or communication interfaces. It should be appreciated that such systems and components/modules/interfaces can include those components or sub-components specified therein, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components. For example, a system could include SSC generator 108, pruning module 510 and transmission processor 512,   or a different combination of these and other components. Sub-components could also be implemented as components communicatively coupled to other components rather than included within parent components. Additionally, it should be noted that one ormore components could be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality. For instance, signal simulation module 608 can include signal correlation module 610, or vice versa, to facilitate determining peak to average power and cross correlation of an SSC by way of a single component. The components may also interact with one or more other components not specifically described herein but known by those of skill in the art. [00103] Furthermore, as will be appreciated, various portions of the disclosed systems above and methods below may include or consist of artificial intelligence or knowledge or rule based components, sub-components, processes, means, methodologies, or mechanisms (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, classifiers. ..). Such components, inter alia, and in addition to that already described herein, can automate certain mechanisms or processes performed thereby to make portions of the systems and methods more adaptive as well as efficient and intelligent. [00104] In view of the exemplary systems described supra, methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter will be better appreciated with reference to the flow charts of FIGs. 9-1 1. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter. Additionally, it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers. The term article of manufacture, as used, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, device in conjunction with a carrier, or storage medium. [00105] Fig. 9 depicts a flowchart of an example methodology 900 for reducing   interference of multiple SSC transmissions according to aspects of the subject disclosure. Method 900, at 902, can generate a sequence matrix. The sequence matrix can comprise M-sequences generated from one or more polynomial expressions. In at least one aspect of the subject disclosure, the M-sequences are generated from apolynomial expression of the form xL5 + xL2 + 1 over GF(2). Additionally, the Msequences can comprise a base sequence and various variations of the base sequence, such as provided by cyclic shifting the base sequence. [00106] At 904, method 900 can scramble at least one M-sequence with a PSCbased scrambling code associated with a wireless communication. The scrambling code can be generated, for instance, based on sequences identified by indices associated with the PSC. In one aspect, the at least one M-sequence scrambled with the scrambling code can comprise a pair of sequences that are multiplexed to form an SSC. The pair of M-sequences can be scrambled prior to or after such multiplexing. In another aspect, the base M-sequence of the above sequence matrix can be the at least one M-sequence scrambled at reference number 904, such that each variation of the scrambled base Msequence is also scrambled. Accordingly, the sequence matrix comprises scrambled sequences according to such aspect. [00107] At 906, method 900 can generate an SSC based on the scrambled Msequence. As indicated above, the SSC can be generated by multiplexing multiple sequences (e.g., sequence pairs, sequence triplets), truncating one or more bits of such sequences, repeating one or more bits of such sequences, or a combination thereof or of the like, as required to generate an SSC of a desired length (e.g., length-62). At 908, method 900 can map the SSC onto sub-components of an OTA message (e.g., subcarrier channels of an OFDM transmission). [00108] An SSC scrambled with a PSC-based scrambling code, generated by method 900, can provide improved interference characteristics for wireless communication. It should be appreciated that the scrambling code can be generated from the same polynomial utilized to generate the SSC, or a polynomial different than that utilized to generate the SSC. In at least one aspect, the polynomial utilized to generate the scrambling code is of the form l+x L2+xL3+xL4+xL5. Further, such polynomial can be utilized to generate a base scrambling sequence. Cyclic shifted variations of the base scrambling sequence can be generated to provide a scrambling   sequence matrix. In one specific aspect of the subject disclosure, twenty or more cyclic shifted variations of the scrambling sequence are generated and combined with the base scrambling sequence to form the scrambling sequence matrix. According to such aspects, the scrambling code can be generated from substantially three sequences of the scrambling sequence matrix. As an example, the base scrambling sequence, a tenthcyclic shifted variation of the base scrambling sequence, and a twentieth cyclic shifted variation of the base scrambling sequence can be utilized to generate the PSC-based scrambling code. [00109] Fig. 10 depicts a flowchart of a sample methodology 1000 for scrambling OTA SSC transmission according to one or more aspects. Method 1000, at 1002, can generate a sequence matrix as described herein. At 1004, method 1000 can select two sequences from the matrix to generate an SSC. The sequences can be selected based on characteristics of an SSC code resulting from the selected sequences. According to one specific example, the characteristics can comprise a PAPR of the SSC code, a cross-correlation factor of the SSC code, or a suitable combination thereof. [00110] At 1006, method 1000 can determine whether the sequences are first scrambled or multiplexed. Such determination can be based on projected interference characteristics of resulting SSC codes, optionally in conjunction with prevailing wireless transmission characteristics of a RAN (e.g. , multi-path scattering, signal reflection/refraction, or the like, as known in the art of radio frequency propagation and/or mobile communication technology). If the sequences are first multiplexed, method 1000 can proceed to 1014, if the sequences are first scrambled, method 1000 can proceed to 1008. [00111] At 1008, method 1000 can generate a PSC-based scrambling code from a sequence matrix generated from one or more polynomial expressions, as described herein (e.g., see methodology 900, supra). At 1010, the two sequences selected from the sequence matrix can be scrambled utilizing the PSC-based scrambling code. At 1012, the sequences can then be interleaved to form an SSC. The SSC can be mapped to an OTA message and transmitted in conjunction with one or more wireless communications . [00112] At 1014, method 1000 can interleave the two sequences selected from the sequence matrix to form a full-length sequence. At 1016, a full-length scrambling   code can be generated as described herein. At 1018, the full-length sequence can be scrambled by employing the scrambling code generated at reference number 1016. Finally, at 1018, an SSC can be generated from the scrambled interleaved sequences, which can be mapped to the OTA message discussed above. [00113] Fig. 11 illustrates a flowchart of a sample methodology 1100 for generating scrambled SSCs according to at least one aspect. At 1102, method 1100 cangenerate an M-sequence from a polynomial expression. The polynomial expression can, in some instances, have the form xL5 + xL2 + 1 over GF(2). At 1104, method 1100 can scramble the M-sequence with a PSC-based scrambling code. The PSC-based scrambling code can be generated from one or more scrambling sequences obtained from one or more scrambling polynomial expressions. According to at least one aspect, the scrambling polynomial expressions can comprise a single expression of the form l+x L2+xL3+xL4+xL5. [00114] At 1106, the scrambled M-sequence is cyclic shifted n times to create n distinct scrambled variations of the scrambled M-sequence. The scrambled M-sequence and n distinct scrambled variations can be compiled into a scrambled sequence matrix. At 1108, two of the scrambled sequences of the scrambled sequence matrix are selected to form an SSC. The selected sequences can be multiplexed to form a full-length scrambled sequence, as described herein. It should be appreciated that the two selected sequences can be based on underlying characteristics of an SSC derived from the sequences. In one aspect, the underlying characteristic comprises a PAPR of the SSC as compared with a PAPR threshold. In another aspect, the underlying characteristic comprises a cross-correlation factor as compared with a correlation threshold. In yet another aspect, the underlying characteristic comprises a suitable combination of the foregoing. [00115] In at least one further aspect, the two selected sequences can be based on a predetermined number of desired SSCs. As a particular example, where the scrambled sequence matrix comprises 3 1 scrambled sequences of length substantially one half the length of a desired SSC code, 170 or 340 sequence pairs can be selected, based on the PAPR and/or cross-correlation characteristics, discussed above. Selection of SSC sequence pairs in such a manner can provide reduced interference for transmitted synchronization information, potentially reducing power consumption of receiving   devices and improving overall communication quality in a mobile communication environment. Accordingly, method 1100 can provide a significant benefit for various mobile communication technologies, as described herein. [00116] Fig. 12 depicts a block diagram of an example system 1200 that can facilitate wireless communication according to some aspects disclosed herein. On a downlink, at access point 1205, a transmit (TX) data processor 1210 receives, formats, codes, interleaves, and modulates (or symbol maps) traffic data and providesmodulation symbols (\"data symbols\"). A symbol modulator 1215 receives and processes the data symbols and pilot symbols and provides a stream of symbols. A symbol modulator 1220 multiplexes data and pilot symbols and provides them to a transmitter unit (TMTR) 1220. Each transmit symbol can be a data symbol, a pilot symbol, or a signal value of zero. The pilot symbols can be sent continuously in each symbol period. The pilot symbols can be frequency division multiplexed (FDM), orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM), time division multiplexed (TDM), code division multiplexed (CDM), or a suitable combination thereof. [00117] TMTR 1220 receives and converts the stream of symbols into one or more analog signals and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and frequency upconverts) the analog signals to generate a downlink signal suitable for transmission over the wireless channel. The downlink signal is then transmitted through an antenna 1225 to the terminals. At terminal 1230, an antenna 1235 receives the downlink signal and provides a received signal to a receiver unit (RCVR) 1240. Receiver unit 1240 conditions (e.g. , filters, amplifies, and frequency downconverts) the received signal and digitizes the conditioned signal to obtain samples. A symbol demodulator 1245 demodulates and provides received pilot symbols to a processor 1250 for channel estimation. Symbol demodulator 1245 further receives a frequency response estimate for the downlink from processor 1250, performs data demodulation on the received data symbols to obtain data symbol estimates (which are estimates of the transmitted data symbols), and provides the data symbol estimates to an RX data processor 1255, which demodulates (i.e., symbol demaps), deinterleaves, and decodes the data symbol estimates to recover the transmitted traffic data. The processing by symbol demodulator 1245 and RX data processor 1255 is complementary to the processing by symbol modulator 1215 and TX data processor 1210, respectively, at access point 1205.   [00118] On the uplink, a TX data processor 1260 processes traffic data and provides data symbols. A symbol modulator 1265 receives and multiplexes the data symbols with pilot symbols, performs modulation, and provides a stream of symbols. A transmitter unit 1270 then receives and processes the stream of symbols to generate an uplink signal, which is transmitted by the antenna 1235 to the access point 1205. Specifically, the uplink signal can be in accordance with SC-FDMA requirements and can include frequency hopping mechanisms as described herein.[00119] At access point 1205, the uplink signal from terminal 1230 is received by the antenna 1225 and processed by a receiver unit 1275 to obtain samples. A symbol demodulator 1280 then processes the samples and provides received pilot symbols and data symbol estimates for the uplink. An RX data processor 1285 processes the data symbol estimates to recover the traffic data transmitted by terminal 1230. A processor 1290 performs channel estimation for each active terminal transmitting on the uplink. Multiple terminals can transmit pilot concurrently on the uplink on their respective assigned sets of pilot subbands, where the pilot subband sets can be interlaced. [00120] Processors 1290 and 1250 direct (e.g., control, coordinate, manage, etc.) operation at access point 1205 and terminal 1230, respectively. Respective processors 1290 and 1250 can be associated with memory units (not shown) that store program codes and data. Processors 1290 and 1250 can also perform computations to derive frequency and impulse response estimates for the uplink and downlink, respectively. [00121] For a multiple-access system (e.g., SC-FDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, CDMA, TDMA, etc.), multiple terminals can transmit concurrently on the uplink. For such a system, the pilot subbands can be shared among different terminals. The channel estimation techniques can be used in cases where the pilot subbands for each terminal span the entire operating band (possibly except for the band edges). Such a pilot subband structure would be desirable to obtain frequency diversity for each terminal. The techniques described herein can be implemented by various means. For example, these techniques can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, which can be digital, analog, or both digital and analog, the processing units used for channel estimation can be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field   programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof. With software, implementation can be through modules (e.g. , procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described herein. The software codes can be stored in memory unit and executed by the processors 1290 and 1250. [00122] Figs. 13, 14, and 15 provide block diagrams of example systems 1300, 1400, 1500 for implementing various aspects of the subject disclosure. System 1300can comprise a module 1302 for generating a sequence matrix from a base M-sequence and cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence. The base M-sequence can be generated from a polynomial expression, as described herein. Bits of each cyclic shifted variation of the base sequence can be either single shifted, double shifted bits, triple shifted bits, etc., or a suitable combination thereof. The base sequence and the shifted variations can be utilized by the module 1302 to form the sequence matrix. [00123] System 1300 can also include a module 1304 for scrambling one or more of the M-sequences. The module 1304 can employ a scrambling code, such as a PSCbased scrambling code to scramble the M-sequences. The scrambling code can be generated by creating a base scrambling sequence from a polynomial expression {e.g., different from that used to generate the sequence matrix), as described herein. Cyclic shifted variations of the base scrambling sequence can be generated, and one or more of the base scrambling sequence and shifted variations can be utilized to generate the scrambling code. [00124] A module 1306 for generating an SSC can create the SSC utilizing at least one scrambled M-sequence. For instance, the scrambled M-sequence(s) can be interleaved, truncated, repeated, or a combination thereof or of the like, as suitable depending on a length of the at least one scrambled M-sequence compared with a desired length of the SSC. System 1300 can further comprise a module 1308 for mapping the SSC onto an OTA transmission. For instance, bits of the SSC can be mapped to sub-carrier channels of an OFDM transmission, code sub-divisions of a CDMA transmission, time sub-divisions of a TDMA transmission, or suitable combinations of integrated systems. As described, system 1300 can generate scrambled SSC codes exhibiting reduced interference in a mobile communication environment.   [00125] System 1400 can comprise a module 1402 for forming a sequence matrix from a base M-sequence and n cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence, as described herein. Further, system 1400 can comprise a module 1404 for indexing sequence pairs of the sequence matrix. The module can generate at least (n+l) L2 indices for each distinct sequence pair of the sequence matrix. Furthermore, system 1400 can comprise a module 1406 for determining PAPR and/or correlation of SSC codes resulting from sequence pairs. The module 1406 can select a predetermined number of sequence pairs {e.g., substantially 170 sequence pairs, substantially 340 sequence pairs, or other suitable number based at least in part on a number of basestations in a mobile site etc.) meeting PAPR and/or cross-correlation thresholds {e.g., below a desired PAPR and/or below a desired correlation factor). Accordingly, SSCs resulting from the selected sequence pairs can have desired transmission characteristics resulting in improved wireless transmission. [00126] System 1500 can comprise a module 1502 for receiving wireless transmissions. The module 1502 can receive one or more wireless OTA transmissions from a mobile network transmitter {e.g., base station(s)). The module 1502 can comprise one or more wireless antenna\\'s {e.g., radio antenna), a receiver for pre conditioning received signals, or the like. System 1500 can further comprise a module 1504 for extracting an SSC from transmissions received by module 1502. Extraction can be based on signal demodulation, conditioning, and the like, as known in the art. A module 1506 for descrambling the SSC can employ a common PSC-based binary descrambling code to decipher the SSC. In one aspect, the descrambling code can be substantially similar to a scrambling code used to scramble the SSC, or a variation {e.g., by inverting the bits of the scrambling code) of such scrambling code. Additionally, system 1500 can comprise a module 1508 for determining an identity of the mobile network transmitter from the deciphered SSC. For instance, a transmitter ID encoded into the SSC can be read and cross-referenced with an ID stored in memory. The transmitter ID can be utilized, for instance, to facilitate wireless communication between a mobile device and the mobile network transmitter. Where received signals exhibit reduced interference, system 1500 can provide reduced power consumption and improved communication reliability in a mobile communication environment.CLAIMS']"
