DETAILED DESCRIPTION In accordance with various embodiments, mechanisms (which can include methods, systems, and media) for indicating viewership of a video are provided. In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can cause indications of viewers who have previously viewed, endorsed, shared, and/or received suggestions to view a particular video to be presented to a first user who is browsing a list of videos. In some embodiments, the viewers can correspond to connections of the first user, such as those who are directly connected to the first user on a social networking service, belong to the same group on a social networking service, and/or have any other suitable connection to the first user. In some embodiments, the indications can include a name of the viewer and/or an image representing the viewer, and the indications can be presented in connection with an identifier of the particular video, thereby allowing the first user browsing the list of videos to quickly identify friends who have watched and/or endorsed the video. In some embodiments, the indications can be presented as belonging to different categories. For example, in some embodiments, the categories can include: users that have endorsed a video, users that have received suggestions to view the video, groups the first user belongs to that have received a suggestion to view the video, users that have suggested that other users view the video, and/or friends that have been identified as likely to enjoy the video. In some such embodiments, viewer indicators can be displayed in any suitable manner that indicates which category the corresponding viewer belongs to. Additionally, in some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can cause a user included in one category to be removed from the other categories. In some embodiments, the mechanisms described herein can identify users corresponding to the viewership indicators and store indications of the identified users for later use, as shown in and described below in connection with FIG. 6 . For example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms can identify the users corresponding to the different categories of viewership indicators for a particular video and can store the user identifiers (e.g., in a cache on a server), and the user identifiers can then be retrieved at a later time, for example, in response to a request from a user device to present a page that includes an indication of the video (e.g., a list of videos that includes the video, a page that includes a thumbnail image associated with the video, and/or any other suitable indication of the video). In some embodiments, the mechanisms can identify users based on interactions with content that are shared by the users publicly. For example, in some embodiments, the mechanisms can identify a user's interactions with content while signed in to a particular user account. Additionally, in instances where the mechanisms do not identify any users, the mechanisms can cause the viewership indicators to be omitted from presentation. Note that, although the mechanisms described herein relate to indicating viewership of a video, in some embodiments, the mechanisms can be used to indicate viewership of any suitable type of media content, such as audio content (e.g., music, radio programs, audiobooks, and/or any other suitable type of audio content), television programs, movies, live streaming media content, electronic books, and/or any other suitable type of media content. Turning to FIG. 1 , an example 100 of a user interface for indicating viewership of a video is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. As illustrated, user interface 100 can include video indicator 102 and a panel of user indicators 104 . Video indicator 102 can be related to any suitable video. For example, in some embodiments, video indicator 102 can include an icon and/or title of a video from a list and/or group of videos that a user is browsing. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, video indicator 102 can be a thumbnail image associated with the video. As shown in user interface 102 , in some embodiments, video indicator 102 can include any suitable images, icons, graphics, animations, hyperlinks, titles, and/or any other suitable content. For example, in some embodiments, video indicator 102 can include a title of the video, a creator of the video, and/or any other suitable information. Panel 104 can indicate users who have watched the video corresponding to video indicator 102 , users who have endorsed and/or liked the video, users who have received suggestions to watch the video, users who have recommended the video to others, and/or users that have been identified as likely to enjoy the video. In some embodiments, the users indicated in panel 104 can be connections of a first user browsing a list of videos. For example, in some embodiments, the indicated users can be a direct connection of the first user on a social networking service (e.g., friends of the first user, and/or any other suitable type of direct connection) or an indirect connection of the first user on the social networking service (e.g., a friend of a friend, and/or any other suitable type of indirect connection). As another example, in some embodiments, the users indicated in panel 104 and the first user browsing the list of videos can belong to a group on a social networking service, have subscribed to a channel of media content, and/or have indicated interest in a similar topic. As shown in panel 104 , users indicated in panel 104 can be subdivided into different categories, each of which indicates a different type of interest in the video. For example, in some embodiments, the categories can include: users who endorsed the video (e.g., by &#x201c;liking&#x201d; the video, commenting on the video, and/or any other suitable type of endorsement, users who have received suggestions to view the video (e.g., by another user sharing the video and/or a link to the video, and/or in any other suitable manner), groups of users that have received suggestions to view the video (e.g., due to the video being posted on a page corresponding to the group, due to the video being sent to all members of the group, and/or in any other suitable manner), users who have shared the video with other users, and users who have been identified as likely to enjoy the video. In some embodiments, each category can be grouped in any suitable manner, as shown in user interface 100 by groups 106 , 108 , 110 , 112 , and 114 . In some embodiments, users who appear in one category can be inhibited from appearing in any other category in panel 104 , as described below in connection with FIGS. 4 and 5 . In some embodiments, any suitable visual indicator can be used to separate categories within panel 104 , such as a line between categories, a box around each category, and/or any other suitable visual indicator. Alternatively, in some embodiments, a visual indicator to separate categories within panel 104 can be omitted. Note that, although five categories are shown in panel 104 and are described herein, in some embodiments, any suitable number (e.g., one, two, four, ten, and/or any other suitable number) of categories can be included. Users and/or groups indicated in panel 104 can be indicated with an icon, a name, and/or any other suitable information, as shown by user indicator 116 in user interface 100 . For example, in some embodiments, user indicator 116 can include a name of the user. As another example, in some embodiments, user indicator 116 can include an image and/or icon representing the user. Note that, in some embodiments, indicators corresponding to different groups can be presented in different manners. For example, in some embodiments, indicators corresponding to a group of users who have been identified as likely to enjoy the video can be presented with a different color scheme (e.g., in black and white, using transparency, and/or any other suitable color scheme) compared to indicators corresponding to a group of users who have endorsed the video. In some embodiments, user indicator 116 can include any other suitable information, such as an indication of whether the user is currently active on a site associated with user interface 100 , an icon indicating a social networking platform from which the user shared and/or endorsed a content item, and/or any other suitable information. Note that, in some embodiments, selection of user indicator 116 can cause any suitable action to occur. For example, in some embodiments, selection of user indicator 116 can cause a profile page associated with the user and/or group to be presented. As another example, in some embodiments, selection of an icon indicating a social networking platform on which the video was shared can cause a browser window presenting user interface 100 to navigate to a page presenting a post in which the video was shared. Note that user interface is shown as an example of a user interface for presenting viewership indicators, and in some embodiments, the viewership indicators can be presented in any other suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, user indicators can be presented without an indication of a category to which the corresponding user belongs. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, user indicators from multiple categories (e.g., friends who liked the video, friends who have tagged others to view the video, and/or any other categories) can be presented within panel 104 without text indicating each group. Turning to FIG. 2 , an example 200 of hardware for indicating viewership of a video that can be used in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter is shown. As illustrated, hardware 200 can include one or more servers such as a data server 202 , a communication network 204 , and/or one or more user devices 206 , such as user devices 208 and 210 . In some embodiments, data server 202 can be any suitable server for storing information relating to users who have viewed a video, users who have endorsed a video, users who have tagged a connection to view a video, and/or any other suitable information. In some embodiments, data server 202 can use the stored information to create indications of users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended a particular video. For example, in some embodiments, the indications can be presented to a first user, for example, if the first user is browsing a list of videos. In some such embodiments, the users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended the particular video can be friends of the first user. In some embodiments, data server 202 can additionally maintain any suitable lists and/or graphs of relationships between users that can be used to create the indications of users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended the video. In some embodiments, data server 202 can identify users corresponding to the viewership indicators at a first time and can store indications of the identified users for presentation at any suitable later time, as shown in and described below in connection with FIG. 6 . In some embodiments, data server 202 can be omitted. Communication network 204 can be any suitable combination of one or more wired and/or wireless networks in some embodiments. For example, communication network 206 can include any one or more of the Internet, an intranet, a wide-area network (WAN), a local-area network (LAN), a wireless network, a digital subscriber line (DSL) network, a frame relay network, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network, a virtual private network (VPN), and/or any other suitable communication network. User devices 206 can be connected by one or more communications links 212 to communication network 204 that can be linked via one or more communications links (e.g., communications link 214 ) to data server 202 . Communications links 212 and/or 214 can be any communications links suitable for communicating data among user devices 206 and server 202 such as network links, dial-up links, wireless links, hard-wired links, any other suitable communications links, or any suitable combination of such links. In some embodiments, user devices 206 can include one or more computing devices suitable for browsing a listing of videos, viewing a video, recommending a video, endorsing a video, suggesting a video to another user, and/or any other suitable functions. For example, in some embodiments, user devices 206 can be implemented as a mobile device, such as a smartphone, mobile phone, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a vehicle (e.g., a car, a boat, an airplane, or any other suitable vehicle) entertainment system, a portable media player, and/or any other suitable mobile device. As another example, in some embodiments, user devices 206 can be implemented as a non-mobile device such as a desktop computer, a set-top box, a television, a streaming media player, a game console, and/or any other suitable non-mobile device. Although data server 202 is illustrated as a single device, the functions performed by data server 202 can be performed using any suitable number of devices in some embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the functions performed by data server 202 can be performed on a single server. As another example, in some embodiments, multiple devices can be used to implement the functions performed by data server 202 . Although two user devices 208 and 210 are shown in FIG. 2 , any suitable number of user devices, and/or any suitable types of user devices, can be used in some embodiments. Data server 202 and user devices 206 can be implemented using any suitable hardware in some embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, devices 202 and 206 can be implemented using any suitable general purpose computer or special purpose computer. For example, a server may be implemented using a special purpose computer. Any such general purpose computer or special purpose computer can include any suitable hardware. For example, as illustrated in example hardware 300 of FIG. 3 , such hardware can include hardware processor 302 , memory and/or storage 304 , an input device controller 306 , an input device 308 , display/audio drivers 310 , display and audio output circuitry 312 , communication interface(s) 314 , an antenna 316 , and a bus 318 . Hardware processor 302 can include any suitable hardware processor, such as a microprocessor, a micro-controller, digital signal processor(s), dedicated logic, and/or any other suitable circuitry for controlling the functioning of a general purpose computer or a special purpose computer in some embodiments. In some embodiments, hardware processor 302 can be controlled by a server program stored in memory and/or storage 304 of a server (e.g., such as server 202 ). For example, the server program can cause hardware processor 302 to store indications of users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended a video, present an indication of connections of a user who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended the video, and/or perform any other suitable actions. In some embodiments, hardware processor 302 can be controlled by a computer program stored in memory and/or storage 304 of user device 206 . For example, the computer program can cause hardware processor 302 to present indications of users who have viewed, endorsed, and/or recommended a video, and/or perform any other suitable actions.

For example, input device controller 306 can be circuitry for receiving input from a touchscreen, from a keyboard, from a mouse, from one or more buttons, from a voice recognition circuit, from a microphone, from a camera, from an optical sensor, from an accelerometer, from a temperature sensor, from a near field sensor, and/or any other type of input device. Display/audio drivers 310 can be any suitable circuitry for controlling and driving output to one or more display/audio output devices 312 in some embodiments. For example, display/audio drivers 310 can be circuitry for driving a touchscreen, a flat-panel display, a cathode ray tube display, a projector, a speaker or speakers, and/or any other suitable display and/or presentation devices. Communication interface(s) 314 can be any suitable circuitry for interfacing with one or more communication networks, such as network 204 as shown in FIG. 2 . For example, interface(s) 314 can include network interface card circuitry, wireless communication circuitry, and/or any other suitable type of communication network circuitry. Antenna 316 can be any suitable one or more antennas for wirelessly communicating with a communication network (e.g., communication network 204 ) in some embodiments. In some embodiments, antenna 316 can be omitted. Bus 318 can be any suitable mechanism for communicating between two or more components 302 , 304 , 306 , 310 , and 314 in some embodiments. Any other suitable components can be included in hardware 300 in accordance with some embodiments. Turning to FIG. 4 , an example 400 of a process for indicating viewership of a video is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. In some embodiments, blocks of process 400 can be executed on data server 202 and/or user device 206 . Process 400 can begin by receiving an indication that viewership information is to be provided to a user at 402 . Process 400 can receive the indication in response to any action and/or information. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can receive the indication in response to determining that a particular page is to be presented. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, the particular page can correspond to a home page of a video sharing service, a home page corresponding to a user account associated with the user for a video sharing service, a page associated with a particular channel of media content on a video sharing service, and/or any other suitable type of page. As another example, in some embodiments, process 400 can receive the indication in response to determining that a first user is browsing a listing of videos, and can determine that information about a particular video in the listing is to be provided (e.g., by determining that the user has selected the particular video, by determining that a cursor is hovering over an icon associated with the particular video, and/or based on any other suitable information). As described above in connection with FIG. 1 , in some embodiments, the viewers of the video can be restricted to direct and/or indirect connections (e.g., on a social networking service) of the first user. Process 400 can identify connections (direct and/or indirect) of the user who have endorsed the video at 404 . For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify connections of the user who have indicated that they watched and liked the video, and/or endorsed the video in any other suitable manner. Process 400 can use any suitable technique or combination of techniques to identify the connections of the user. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can query a database (e.g., on data server 202 ) for users who have both endorsed the video and are connected to the first user. In some such embodiments, process 400 can specify any suitable level of connection. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify only users who are directly connected to the first user, users who are connected by less than a predetermined degree of separation, and/or based on any other suitable criteria. Alternatively, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users who belong to a particular group with the first user and/or who have subscribed to a channel of a media content with the first user. Note that, in some embodiments, the connections identified at block 404 can correspond to the users displayed in category 106 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . A more particular example of a process for identifying connections of the user who have endorsed the video is shown in and described below in connection with FIG. 6 . Note that, in some embodiments, process 400 can additionally or alternatively identify groups that have endorsed the channel of media content or the video. For example, in some embodiments, the groups can include a group on a social networking service, channels of media content available on a video sharing service, and/or any other suitable type of group(s). Process 400 can identify connections of the first user who have received suggestions to view the video at 406 . In some embodiments, the identified users can be those who have received a message with a link to the video, users who have had the video posted on a profile page on a social networking service by another user, and/or received a suggestion to view the video in any other suitable manner. As described above, the identified users can be connected to the first user directly or indirectly in any suitable manner. Similarly to at block 404 , the users can be identified using any suitable techniques, for example, by querying a database. Note that, in some embodiments, the connections identified at block 406 can correspond to the users displayed in category 108 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . Process 400 can identify groups that have received suggestions to view the video at 408 . In some embodiments, the identified groups can be ones that the first user belongs to. For example, in some embodiments, the groups can include those that the user has joined on a social networking service, groups that correspond to users who have subscribed to a particular channel of media content, and/or any other suitable groups. Similarly to at blocks 404 and 406 , the groups can be identified using any suitable techniques, for example, by querying a database. Note that, in some embodiments, the groups identified at block 408 can correspond to the group(s) displayed in category 110 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . Process 400 can identify connections of the first user who have shared the video with other users at 410 . For example, in some embodiments, the identified connections can include those who have sent a message to another user that includes the video and/or a link to the video, those who have posted the video and/or a link to the video on a page associated with another user, and/or those who have shared the video in any other suitable manner. Similarly to at blocks 404 - 408 , the users can be identified using any suitable techniques, for example, by querying a database. Note that, in some embodiments, the users identified at block 410 can correspond to the users displayed in category 112 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . Process 400 can identify connections of the first user who are likely to enjoy the video at 412 based on any suitable information. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users connected to the first user who have endorsed similar videos. As a more particular example, if the video relates to a particular topic, process 400 can identify connections of the user who have previously endorsed videos related to the topic. As another example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users connected to the first user who are interested in a topic associated with the video. In some such embodiments, the users can be identified based on collections of video content the user has subscribed to and/or otherwise endorsed, interests indicated on a social networking service, and/or using any other suitable information. As yet another example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users connected to the first user who have endorsed videos determined to be similar to videos viewed by the first user. In some such embodiments, similarity can be determined using any suitable information, such as metadata indicating topics of the videos, creators of the videos, and/or any other suitable information. Note that, in some embodiments, the users identified at block 412 can correspond to the users displayed in category 114 as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 . Process 400 can create one or more groups of indicators relating to the connections and groups identified in blocks 404 - 412 at 414 . For example, as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 , the group of indicators can include those presented in panel 104 of user interface 100 . As shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 , each group of indicators can correspond to a category (e.g., users that have endorsed content, users that have tagged another user to view content, users determined to be likely to enjoy the content, and/or any other suitable categories, as described above). Additionally, each group of indicators can include any suitable number of user indicators, as shown in panel 104 of FIG. 1 . Similarly to user indicator 116 in FIG. 1 , each indicator can include a name of the user and/or group, an icon and/or image representing the user and/or group, and/or any other suitable information. Note that, in some embodiments, any suitable number of indicators can be created. For example, in some embodiments, an indicator corresponding to each identified connection and/or group can be created. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, indicators corresponding to a subset of the identified connections and/or groups can be created. In some such embodiments, process 400 can identify any suitable subset. For example, in some embodiments, process 400 can identify users and/or groups based on a level of interaction with the first user (e.g., users and/or groups the first user has most recently interacted with, users and/or groups the first user has interacted with the most number of times, and/or any other suitable metric), and/or based on any other suitable criteria. In some embodiments, each category represented in panel 104 can include a different number of user indicators, and any suitable number of indicators can be included in each category. Note that, in some embodiments, process 400 can deduplicate users represented in multiple categories. For example, if a particular user has both endorsed the video and has shared the video with other users, process 400 can remove the user from one of the two categories. In some embodiments, inclusion in categories can be ranked and/or ordered. For example, in some embodiments, the ordering of categories can be: users who have endorsed a video, users who have received suggestions to view the video, groups which have received suggestions to view the video, users who have shared the video with others, and users who have been identified as likely to enjoy the video. In some embodiments, users that can belong to more than one category can be placed in the highest-ranking category and removed from all other categories. A process for modifying a category that a user belongs to is shown in and described below in connection with FIG. 5 . Process 400 can cause the group of indicators to be presented on a user device associated with the first user at 416 . For example, as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 , process 400 can cause the group of indicators to be presented in connection with an indicator (e.g., a thumbnail image associated with the video, and/or any other suitable indicator) of the video. As another example, in some embodiments, the groups of indicators can be grouped into multiple categories, as shown in panel 104 of FIG. 1 . Turning to FIG. 5 , an example 500 of a process for storing indications of viewership of a video is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. Note that although process 500 describes storing indications of users sharing a video and endorsing a video, the techniques described below can be applied to any suitable actions. In some embodiments, blocks of process 500 can be executed by data server 202 . Process 500 can begin by receiving an indication that a first user has recommended that a second user watch a video at 502 . As described above in connection with FIGS. 1 and 4 , the first user and the second user can be connected in any suitable manner (e.g., a direct connection on a social networking service, an indirect connection on a social networking service, both belong to a particular group on a social networking service, both have subscribed to media content associated with a particular channel, and/or any other suitable type of connection). The recommendation can be made in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, the first user can send the second user a message that includes a link to the video. Process 500 can store an indication that the first user recommended and/or shared the video at 504 . In some embodiments, the indication can be stored in any suitable location (e.g., in memory 304 of data server 202 ) and using any suitable techniques. For example, in some embodiments, the indication can be stored in a database with an identifier associated with the first user as a key. In some embodiments, the stored indication can cause the first user to be identified by process 400 at block 410 (e.g., to identify users that have shared a video with other users). Process 500 can store an indication that the second user has received a suggestion to view the video at 506 . Similarly to at block 504 , the indication can be stored in any suitable location using any suitable techniques, such as in a database in data server 202 . In some embodiments, the stored indication can cause the second user to be identified by process 400 at block 406 (e.g., to identify users that have received a suggestion to view the video). Process 500 can receive an indication that the second user has endorsed the video at 508 . For example, in some embodiments, process 500 can receive information indicating that the second user selected a link associated with the video and, after presentation of the video, indicated that they enjoyed the video (e.g., by selecting an icon indicating that they liked the video) and/or endorsed the video in any suitable manner. Process 500 can store an indication that the second user endorsed the video at 510 . Similarly to blocks 504 and 506 , the indication can be stored in any suitable location using any suitable techniques, such as in a database in data server 202 . In some embodiments, the stored indication can cause the second user to be identified by process 400 at block 404 (e.g., to identify users that have endorsed the video). Process 500 can additionally remove the indication stored at block 506 that indicates that the second user received the suggestion to view the video in any suitable manner. For example, in some embodiments, process 500 can change a flag setting associated with the second user that indicates whether the second user received a suggestion to view the video. Note that, in some embodiments, process 500 can store indications for a particular user to ensure that only a predetermined number of indications have been stored for that user. For example, in some embodiments, if an indication that a user has endorsed a particular video has been stored, process 500 can remove indications that the user was likely to enjoy the video, that the user received a suggestion to view the video, and/or any other suitable indications. In some embodiments, process 500 can prioritize indications in any suitable order, for example, by prioritizing an indication that the user endorsed the video over an indication that the user received a suggestion to view the video, that the user is likely to enjoy the video, and/or that the user suggested the video to another user. In some embodiments, removing and/or deleting multiple indications can be used to deduplicate categories of video viewership to ensure that a particular user is included in only one category. Additionally, note that in some embodiments, process 500 can store an indication that a user has disliked a video. In some such embodiments, process 500 can then remove any other indications related to the user and the video and can cause the user to not appear in a group of indicators of viewership. Furthermore, in some embodiments, process 500 can receive an indication that a user that has been tagged to view a video has removed the tag (e.g., by deleting their name from the tag, deleting a comment or post in which they were tagged, and/or in any other suitable manner), and in response, process 500 can remove and/or delete a stored indication that the user was tagged to view the video. Turning to FIG. 6 , an example 600 of a process for identifying, for a particular channel of media content and/or a particular video, a group of users to be included in a group of indicators of viewership of the particular channel of media content and/or video is shown in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. Process 600 can begin by identifying a particular channel of media content and/or a particular video at 602 for which indicators of viewership are to be presented. Process 600 can identify the channel of media content and/or the video using any suitable technique(s) and based on any suitable information. For example, in some embodiments, the channel of media content and/or the video can be one included in a video service home page presented to a particular user authenticated with a corresponding user account. As a more particular example, in some embodiments, the channel of media content can include a channel that the user has subscribed to, a channel that is recommended for the user based on interests the user has indicated (e.g., in one or more posts on a social networking site, a profile associated with the user, and/or indicated in any other suitable manner), and/or any other suitable channels. As another more particular example, in some embodiments, the particular video can be one that is recommended for the user based on previously endorsed content, a video that has been determined to be a currently popular video (e.g., has received more than a predetermined number of views within a recent time period, and/or identified using any other suitable popularity metrics), and/or any other suitable video. Process 600 can identify a first group of users at 604 . The first group of users can include any suitable users, such as those that are associated with user accounts on a particular video sharing service, those that are associated with user accounts on a particular social networking service, and/or any other suitable users. In some embodiments, consent can be requested from users to be included in the first group of users, for example, as part of settings associated with a user account. At 606 , for each user in the first group of users, process 600 can determine an affinity score for the user and the channel of media content and/or the video. Process 600 can determine the affinity score based on any suitable information and using any suitable technique(s). For example, in some embodiments, the affinity score can be based on whether the user has viewed content produced by the channel of media content, has endorsed (e.g., indicated that they enjoyed) content produced by the channel of media content, has endorsed the video, has shared content produced by the channel of media content (e.g., in a social networking post), has shared the video (e.g., in a social networking post), has subscribed to the channel of media content, has commented on the video, and/or has interacted with the channel of media content or the video in any other suitable manner. In instances where the user has interacted with the channel of media content or the video in multiple instances (e.g., commented on the video and endorsed the video), process 600 can weigh the interactions in any suitable manner to calculate the affinity score based on the multiple interactions. For example, in some embodiments, endorsements can be weighed more heavily than viewing content, sharing content can be weighed more heavily than commenting on content, etc. Note that, in some embodiments, multiple affinity scores can be calculated for each of multiple types of interaction, and, in some such embodiments, each affinity score can be a Boolean value. For example, in some embodiments, an affinity score indicating whether the user has endorsed content associated with the channel of media content or the video can be a Boolean value, where a value of &#x201c;true&#x201d; indicates that the user has endorsed the content and a value of &#x201c;false&#x201d; indicates that the user has not endorsed the content. Process 600 can store the affinity score(s) in any suitable location, for example, in memory 304 of data server 202 . As a more particular example, in some embodiments, the affinity score(s) can be stored in a cache within memory 304 of data server 202 . In some such embodiments, the affinity score(s) can be stored in the cache for any suitable time period (e.g., a day, a week, a month, and/or any other suitable time period). Note that, in some embodiments, blocks 602 - 606 can be repeated for multiple channels of media content and/or videos, and the affinity scores for the multiple channels or videos and groups of users can be stored for later use, for example, on data server 202 . At 608 , process 600 can receive a request to present, to a user of a user device, groups of viewership indicators corresponding to the channel of media content or the video. Process 600 can receive the request based on any suitable action(s). For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can receive the request in response to a determination that the user has navigated to a particular page on the user device. As a more particular example, the page can include a home page corresponding to a user account of the user on a video sharing service or social networking service, a page corresponding to a particular channel of media content or a particular video (e.g., the channel of media content or the video described above in connection with block 602 ), and/or any other suitable page. Note that, in some embodiments, process 600 may not receive a request to present the group of viewership indicators. In some such embodiments, process 600 may identify the groups of viewership indicators and may store the identified groups of viewership indicators to be presented to the user at a later time. Process 600 can identify a second group of users connected to the user of the user device at 610 . As described above in connection with FIGS. 4 and 5 , each user in the second group of users can be connected to the user of the user device directly or indirectly. For example, in some embodiments, users who are directly connected may be direct connections on any suitable social networking service, have directly exchanged messages through any suitable communication interface (e.g., an instant messaging interface, e-mail, and/or any other suitable communication interface), and/or be directly connected in any other suitable manner. As another example, users who are indirectly connected may both belong to the same group on a social networking service, both be subscribed to the same channel of media content on a video sharing service, have a direct connection in common with both users, and/or be indirectly connected in any other suitable manner. Process 600 can identify the second group of users connected to the user of the user device using any suitable technique or combination of techniques. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can identify direct connections of the user on multiple networking platforms (e.g., one or more communication interfaces, social networking services, video sharing services, and/or any other suitable networking platforms). As another example, in some embodiments, process 600 can identify indirect connections and/or suggested connections by identifying groups the user of the user device belongs to, connections separated from the user of the user device by any suitable degree on a networking platform, and/or based on any other suitable information. Process 600 can determine a viewership status corresponding to the channel of media content or the video for each user in the second group of users at 612 . In some embodiments, the viewership status can indicate that the user belongs to a particular category. For example, in some embodiments, the categories can include users that have endorsed the channel of media content or video, users that have not watched content from the channel of media content or have not watched the video but are likely to enjoy the content, and users that do not belong to either of the previous categories. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the viewership status can include any other suitable categories, such as users that have been tagged by another user to view the content, users that have viewed the content but not endorsed the content, users that have shared the content on a social networking service, and/or any other suitable categories. In some embodiments, the categories can correspond to those shown in and described above in connection with panel 104 of FIG. 1 and blocks 404 - 412 of FIG. 4 . Note that, in some embodiments, the viewership status of a particular user corresponding to a particular channel of media content or particular video can be determined based on the user's interactions with the content that are publically available. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can determine the viewership status for each user and content combination based on interactions that occurred with the content while the user was signed in to a user account. In some embodiments, permission can be requested from the user to store and/or use any information relating to the user's interactions with content. At 614 , process 600 can identify a subset of the second group of users who are to be included in the group of viewership indicators based on the viewership status determined at block 612 . Process 600 can identify the subset using any suitable techniques. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can first determine a number of categories of viewership indicators to be presented (e.g., as shown in and described above in connection with FIG. 1 ), and can then identify a subset of users corresponding to each of the categories. As a more particular example, in instances where process 600 determines that the categories are to include users who have endorsed the channel of media content or the video and users that would likely enjoy the channel of media content or video, process 600 can then identify, based on the viewership status, users corresponding to each of the two categories. In some embodiments, process 600 can identify any suitable number (e.g., one, two, five, ten, twenty, and/or any other suitable number) of users in each category. In instances where more users belong to each category than are to be indicated in the group of viewership indicators, process 600 can select the users in the subset based on any suitable criteria. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can select the users in the subset based on an affinity score and/or a score indicating a strength of a relationship between the user in the subset of users and the user to be presented with the viewership indicators. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can sort the users in the subset based on the strength of their relationship with the user to be presented with the viewership indicators, and can select the top N (e.g., one, two, five, ten, twenty, and/or any other suitable number) users in each category. In some embodiments, process 600 can use any suitable information and/or technique(s) to determine a strength of the relationship, for example, a number of interactions between the two users (e.g., number of messages sent, number of comments on posts on a social networking service, and/or any other suitable communication), a frequency of interaction, and/or any other suitable metric. In some embodiments, process 600 can cause the group of viewership indicators to be presented (e.g., as described above in connection with FIGS. 1 and 4 ) based on the identified subset of the second group of users. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, process 600 can store the identified subset of users for presentation on the user device at a later time. For example, in some embodiments, the subset of users can be identified and stored in a cache in memory 304 of data server 202 , and process 600 can cause the corresponding viewership indicators to be presented at a later time, for example, in response to a request from the user device (e.g., a request for a particular page, and/or any other suitable request). In instances where process 600 stored the identified subset of users, process 600 can verify the viewership status of each user in the subset of users and the connection status of each user in the subset of users to a user of the user device at 616 . For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can verify that users who were identified as having endorsed the channel of media content and/or the video have not retracted and/or modified their endorsement in the time since they were identified. As another example, in some embodiments, process 600 can verify that users who were identified as likely to enjoy the video have not viewed the video in the time since they were identified. As yet another example, in some embodiments, process 600 can verify that users who were identified as a direct connection of the user of the user device have not modified their connection status (e.g., retracted a friendship status on a social networking service, and/or modified a connection status in any other suitable manner) in the time since they were identified. In some embodiments, process 600 can loop back to block 602 and can identify a second channel of media content or a second video. For example, in some embodiments, process 600 can loop through a list of channels and/or videos for which viewership indicators are to be created, and can store information relating to the viewership indicators (e.g., as described in blocks 606 and 612 ). The stored information can then be retrieved at any suitable later time, for example, in response to receiving a request to present a page on which the viewership indicators are to be presented. In some embodiments, at least some of the above described blocks of the processes of FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 can be executed or performed in any order or sequence not limited to the order and sequence shown in and described in connection with the figures. Also, some of the above blocks of FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 can be executed or performed substantially simultaneously where appropriate or in parallel to reduce latency and processing times. Additionally or alternatively, some of the above described blocks of the processes of FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 can be omitted. In some embodiments, any suitable computer readable media can be used for storing instructions for performing the functions and/or processes herein. For example, in some embodiments, computer readable media can be transitory or non-transitory. For example, non-transitory computer readable media can include media such as magnetic media (such as hard disks, floppy disks, and/or any other suitable magnetic media), optical media (such as compact discs, digital video discs, Blu-ray discs, and/or any other suitable optical media), semiconductor media (such as flash memory, electrically programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and/or any other suitable semiconductor media), any suitable media that is not fleeting or devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission, and/or any suitable tangible media. As another example, transitory computer readable media can include signals on networks, in wires, conductors, optical fibers, circuits, any suitable media that is fleeting and devoid of any semblance of permanence during transmission, and/or any suitable intangible media. In situations in which the systems described herein collect personal information about users, or make use of personal information, the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information (e.g., information about a user's social network, social actions or activities, profession, a user's preferences, or a user's current location). In addition, certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used, so that personal information is removed. For example, a user's identity may be treated so that no personal information can be determined for the user, or a user's geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained (such as to a city, ZIP code, or state level), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus, the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server. Accordingly, methods, systems, and media for indicating viewership of a video are provided. Although the invention has been described and illustrated in the foregoing illustrative embodiments, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made only by way of example, and that numerous changes in the details of implementation of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which is limited only by the claims that follow. Features of the disclosed embodiments can be combined and rearranged in various ways.\"]"

       "'1  USE OF CAS PROTEIN, METHOD FOR DETECTING TARGET NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULE, AND KIT TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention belongs to the field of biotechnology, and in particular to a method for 5 detecting a target nucleic acid molecule. BACKGROUND A specific nucleic acid detection method has an important application value, such as pathogen detection, genetic disease detection, etc. In an aspect of pathogen detection, since each pathogen microorganism has its unique characteristic nucleic acid molecular sequence, it is possible to 10 develop nucleic acid molecular detection for specific species, also known as nucleic acid diagnostic (NAD), which is of great significance in the fields of food safety, environmental microorganism pollution detection, human pathogen infection, etc. Another aspect is the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in human or other species. Understanding the relationship between a genetic variation and a biological function at the genomic level provides a new 15 perspective for modern molecular biology. SNP is closely related to biological functions, evolution and diseases, so the development of SNP detection and analysis technologies is particularly important. At present, many NAD methods have been established, mainly for the detection of a specific DNA molecule, and there are also some methods for RNA molecules. Generally speaking, a DNA 20 molecule is very stable, so a test sample can come from a series of complex biological samples; while RNA is very easy to degrade, so it needs to be handled with great care. In the 1970s, a detection method using restriction endonuclease digestion was established. Later, methods such as Southern, Northern and dot blot hybridization were developed for specific detection of a nucleic acid molecule. In 1985, when PCR became a conventional experimental method, it led to an 25 exponential improvement in molecular biology. Currently established specific nucleic acid molecule detection usually needs to be performed in two steps, the first step being the amplification 2 of a target nucleic acid and the second step being the detection of the target nucleic acid. PCR technology is an amplification method that is first established and most commonly used at present. Currently, based on the PCR method, a fluorescent-labeled probe is introduced, such that the amplification situation of a target can be detected in real time, which is called Realtime PCR. The Realtime PCR is not only a fast and highly-sensitive detection method, but also a method for 5 quantitative analysis. In addition to the PCR amplification method, many alternative methods have been established, such as ligase chain reaction, branched DNA amplification, NASBA, SDA, transcription-mediated amplification, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), rolling circle amplification (RCA), Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA), etc. The advantage of many of these alternative methods is isothermality. That is to say, only one temperature is needed 10 to complete the reaction, without the need for a thermal cycling instrument like that used in PCR. Among nucleic acid detection methods, besides the Realtime PCR that can directly complete amplification and detection, the FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization) technology is the most commonly-used detection method - a method in which a labeled molecular probe is in situ hybridized with a complementary target sequence. In addition, detection methods such as next-15 generation sequencing technologies and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies have also been developed, but these methods usually require expensive experimental equipment. The detection of SNPs also first requires amplification by a method such as PCR and the like, so as to obtain sufficient SNP site-containing region fragments for further detection. Commonly used methods include: primer extension, hybridization, ligation, and enzymatic cleavage. When 20 the above methods are completed, a specific method needs to be utilized for detection, such as mass spectrometry detection, fluorescence detection, chemiluminescence detection, etc. Although many detection methods have been developed for nucleic acid detection as described above, in certain cases, how to detect more quickly, simply and less expensively is still an important development direction, such as rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria in the field, rapid 25 detection of drug-sensitive SNPs, etc. In 2016, Collins et al. developed a rapid and inexpensive method for detecting the Zika virus based on the characteristic of CRISPR-Cas9 of specifically 3 recognizing and cleaving a target sequence. In 2017, Feng Zhang et al. established a rapid nucleic acid detection method utilizing a feature of ﬁcollateral effectﬂ of CRISPR-Cas13a. The ﬁcollateral effect\" means that Cas13a binds to a specific target RNA and then randomly cleaves other non-target RNAs (here RNA molecules are designed as an RNA fluorescence reporting system); rapid target RNA detection is realized by combining with an isothermal amplification technology RPA; 5 and the team of Feng Zhang called this detection method as SHERLOCK (Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing). The SHERLOCK method involves the binding to an RNA template, so if DNA detection is required, the DNA needs to be firstly transcribed into an RNA template for detection; and given the instability of RNA, this method will undoubtedly increase the difficulty of operation. 10 In 2015, Feng Zhang et al. discovered a new CRISPR-related endoproteinase Cas12a (formerly known as Cpf1), which, like a commonly used Cas9 protein, is an RNA-guided specific DNA endonuclease; however, compared with Cas9, Cas12a has its own characteristics, for example, only a crRNA is needed to guide the specific cleavage of a double-stranded DNA and a sticky end is produced. 15 SUMMARY An objective of the present invention is to provide a method for detecting a target nucleic acid molecule.

All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts fall within the protection scope of the present invention. The inventor has developed a technical solution for target nucleic acid detection through extensive and in-depth research and through research on the cleavage characteristics of a Cas 5 enzyme (such as Cas12a and Cas12b enzymes). The experimental results show that a nucleic acid is detected successfully and rapidly by employing the above-mentioned technical solution, for example, for the identification of whether there is a certain concentration of microorganisms such as Escherichia coli in water, and for the rapid identification of an SNP genotype. The present invention is completed on this basis. 10 Terms The term \"guide RNA\" refers to an RNA that guides a Cas protein to specifically bind to a target DNA sequence.

The PAM of FnCas12a is a TTN sequence, the PAM of LbCas12a is a TTTN sequence, 15 and the PAM of AacCas12b is TTN. The present invention discloses a method for detecting a target nucleic acid molecule, which includes: adding a guide RNA, a Cas protein, a nucleic acid probe and a buffer solution into a reaction system containing a target nucleic acid molecule to be detected, and then performing fluorescence detection of the target nucleic acid molecule. 5 The Cas protein is Cas12a or Cas12b. The Cas12a is preferably one of FnCas12a, AsCas12a, LbCas12a, Lb5Cas12a, HkCas12a, OsCas12a, TsCas12a, BbCas12a, BoCas12a or Lb4Cas12a; and the Cas12a is preferably LbCas12a.

The target nucleic acid molecule to be detected in the reaction system of the target nucleic acid molecule to be detected is obtained by amplification. The detection method can detect a pathogenic microorganism, gene mutation, or a specific 15 target DNA. Use of a Cas protein in a method for detecting a target nucleic acid molecule. When a target DNA, a guide RNA and a Cas protein form a ternary complex, the complex will cleave other single-stranded DNA molecules in the system. A guide RNA refers to an RNA that guides a Cas protein to specifically target a DNA sequence. 20 The present invention also provides a kit including a guide RNA, a Cas protein, and a nucleic acid probe. Furthermore, the kit of the present invention can also include a buffer solution. The present invention provides a detection method for rapidly detecting a target nucleic acid molecule with high specificity. Once the (single-stranded or double-stranded) target DNA, the crRNA and the Cas12a protein form a ternary complex, the complex will cleave other single-25 stranded DNA molecules in the system. Through designing, the crRNA targets the target DNA (a segment of DNA sequence to be detected); the crRNA and the Cas12a protein are added into the 16 detection system; when the target DNA is present, the Cas12a forms a ternary complex with the crRNA and the target DNA, and meanwhile, the complex exerts its collateral cleavage activity and cleaves a single-stranded DNA labeled with a fluorescent signal (two ends of the single-stranded DNA are respectively connected with a luminescent group and a quenching group, and the luminescent group can emit light after being cleaved), thereby emitting fluorescence. Therefore, 5 whether the system to be detected contains the target DNA molecule can be known by fluorescence detection. By using the method of the present invention, whether a specific DNA sequence is contained in a sample can be quickly detected. The sensitivity of the detection method can be greatly improved by combining with a PCR technology. The nucleic acid probe in the present invention is preferably a fluorescent probe. 10 HOLMES condition testing: The present invention provides use of Cas12 enzymes such as Cas12a and Cas12b in nucleic acid detection. The following description will take Cas12a as an example. Selection of Cas12a: according to research, Cas12a has a trans-cleavage activity, that is, once the target DNA, the crRNA and the Cas12a protein form a ternary complex, other single-stranded 15 DNAs (collateral single-stranded DNAs) in the system will be cleaved. According to this principle, a specific DNA detection method is designed. First, the collateral DNA is designed as a fluorescent probe, which consists of a random sequence of 12 nt, and is labeled with a fluorescent group HEX at the 5\\' terminal and a quenching group BHQ1 (HEX-N12-BHQ1) at the 3\\' terminal. When the target DNA fragment is contained in the system, a ternary complex of the target DNA, the crRNA 20 and the Cas12a protein will be formed. At this time, the probe will be cleaved, and meanwhile, the HEX fluorescent group will emit fluorescence (with an excitation light at 535 nM and an emission light at 556 nM) as detected by a fluorescence detector. Next, 10 different Cas12as are tested, and the target sequence is a double-stranded DNA as shown in FIG. 7. It can be seen that the complex composed of the target double-stranded DNA and each Cas12a protein can realize the trans 25 cleavage activity. HOLMES response sensitivity: then, the response sensitivities of FnCas12a and LbCas12a 17 to the target DNA are tested, that is to say, the lowest concentration of the target DNA at which the response can occur is investigated. As shown in FIG. 9, when the test target is directly added, they can respond to the target DNA with a concentration above 0.1 nM, and the response is remarkable when the concentration is above 1 nM. If a PCR technology (the HOLMES method) is combined, as shown in FIG. 8, i.e., amplification of the fragment of interest through PCR followed 5 by a Cas12a cleavage reaction, the response sensitivity can be as low as 10 aM, as shown in FIG. 9. SNP Test: next, whether the HOLMES method can detect an SNP genotype is tested. T1 is taken as a target sequence, PAM at this site is mutated or positions 1-18 of the target sequence are respectively subjected to single-point mutation, and the detection differences between a non-10 mutated sequence and a mutated sequence by crRNAs of different lengths are compared. As shown in FIG. 10, when the complementary sequence of the target is a crRNA of 24 nt (crRNA-24nt), the single-point mutation at the positions 8-18 is not much different from the wild type, while the fluorescence value decreases obviously after the PAM mutation and the mutation of positions 1-7. When the crRNA is truncated and the length of a paired target sequence is 18 nt, 15 the fluorescence value of the mutation positions of 8-16 nt is obviously decreased compared with that of a target sequence having a length of 24 nt; when the length of the crRNA continues to be shortened to 16 nt or 17 nt, the fluorescence value of the mutated target sequence decreases more significantly; and when it is further shortened to 15 nt, the fluorescence value of the mutated target sequence is weaker as compared with that of this target sequence, but the fluorescence intensity of 20 the mutated target sequence may still be higher as compared with those of other target sequences, and thus can be used for detection. Taken together, the crRNAs of 15 nt, 16 nt and 17 nt are the most suitable for SNP detection. In the present invention, the Cas12a cleaves the single-stranded DNA in a PAM-sequence independent programmed cleaving manner, which is called cis cleavage; but once the ternary 25 complex Cas12a/crRNA/target DNA is formed, it will show a trans-cleavage activity, i.e., exhibiting an activity of cleaving any non-target single-stranded DNA in the system. 18 Based on the characteristics of Cas12a, a method for specific nucleic acid molecule detection is developed, which is called HOLMES (one HOur Low-cost Multipurpose Efficient Simple assay). Just like the name of the technology, it is characterized by a fast speed (1 hour), a low price, multiple channels, high efficiency and a simple test method. The method can be used in the fields of rapid pathogen detection, SNP detection and the like. 5 Nucleic acid detection based on the collateral cleavage activity The present invention also provides a nucleic acid detection method based on the collateral cleavage activity of the Cas12 enzyme (including Cas12a or Cas12b). Preferably, the detection of the present invention can be performed for SNP, and in particular PCR amplification is performed first followed by detection. 10 Referring to FIG. 18, a primer design scheme is given. Case 1. When there is a PAM site near the SNP site, and a crRNA synthesized based on a guide sequence designed according to the PAM site can be used for HOLMES detection. When the HOLMES method is used for detection, it shows a relatively low background signal; and for the same guide sequence, signal differences between different SNP templates are quite large. 15 Case 2. When there is no PAM site or no suitable PAM site near the SNP site, a PAM site can be introduced according to the above experimental scheme. A typical step includes designing a primer near the SNP site, and carrying a PAM site on the primer, where the sequence located at the 3™ terminal of the PAM site should be paired with the template DNA. There is no special requirement on the primer at the other terminal, as long as the 20 primer can be paired with template DNA and can be used for PCR amplification. As shown in FIG. 18, PAM sites can be successfully introduced after PCR amplification. Referring to FIG. 10, in the present invention, when designing introduction of the PAM site, the SNP site is usually located at the first 16 bases of the 5\\' terminal of the crRNA guide sequence, preferably at positions 1-14, more preferably at positions 1-12, still more preferably at positions 1-25 11 or 1-10, and most preferably at positions 1-8 or 1-7. The present invention has the following main advantages: 19 (1) Fast speed: when the test conditions are ready, it only takes about 1 hour from the time of obtaining a sample to the time of obtaining test results. (2) Low cost: there are no special materials or enzymes in the experiment, and it involves a small quantity of materials and reagents, and thus it can be used for trace analysis. (3) High efficiency: the present invention has extremely high sensitivity and can detect DNA 5 at a concentration of 10 aM. (4) Multiple uses: it can detect different nucleic acid samples, including DNA samples and RNA samples. (5) Simplicity: there are no special or complicated steps, and if a kit is prepared and a program is set, only simple operations such as adding a sample are required. 10 The present invention will be described in detail below in connection with specific examples. It should be understood that the following examples are only intended to illustrate the present invention, rather than limiting the scope of the present invention. The experimental methods in the following examples which are not specified with specific conditions are generally carried out according to conventional conditions, such as those described in Sambrook et al., Molecular 15 Cloning: Laboratory Manual (New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989), or those recommended by manufacturers. Unless otherwise stated, percentages and parts are weight percentages and parts by weight. Unless otherwise stated specifically, the experimental materials involved in the present invention can be obtained from commercial channels. 20 Materials 1.

Medium formula: a liquid LB (1% Tryptone, 0.5% Yeast extract, 1% NaCl), and only 2% agar needs to be added into the liquid LB when a solid LB is prepared. Example 1 Cas12a protein detection capable of detecting a single-stranded DNA target (the probe being labeled with FAM) A single-stranded DNA (target-T1-R) was selected as a target sequence to test the response 5 values of its detection by different Cas12a proteins. 1. Preparation of crRNA: first, a transcription template was prepared by annealing T7-crRNA-F to a synthesized oligonucleotide T7-T1-24-R as shown in Table 5. Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (4 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, 10 and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for about 16 h). Then RNA was purified using the RNA purification and concentration kit, quantified with NanoDrop 2000C (Thermo Fisher Scientific), diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C. 15 2. Cas12a reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with the crRNA (0.5 !M) purified in step 1, a Cas12a (0.25 !M), a target single-stranded DNA (target-T1-R) (0.01 !M), a nucleic acid probe (N25-5\\' FAM) (0.01 !M), a buffer solution of NEB buffer 3.1, and 0.5 !L of an RNase inhibitor. The blank control reaction was a reaction in which all other components were added except the single-stranded DNA target sequence. Reaction was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, and 20 then terminated at 98°C for 2 min. 3. Fluorescence detection: the reaction was subjected to urea-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (Urea-PAGE), and then detected with a fluorescence luminescence imager. As shown in FIG. 11, different Cas12as have different detection effects on the target. For example, for HkCas12a, etc., cleavage of the probe was caused even when no target single-stranded DNA was added. LbCas12a 25 and the like are better candidates of Cas12a proteins because the cleavage of the probe occurred only when the target single-stranded DNA was added. 21 Example 2 Cas12a protein detection capable of detecting a single-stranded DNA target (the probe being labelled with two labels of HEX and BHQ1) A single-stranded DNA (target-T1-R) was selected as a target sequence to test the response values of its detection by different Cas12a proteins. 1. Preparation of crRNA: first, a transcription template was prepared by annealing T7-crRNA-5 F to a synthesized oligonucleotide T7-T1-24-R (Table 5). Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (4 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C 10 (for about 16 h). Then RNA was purified using the RNA purification and concentration kit, quantified with NanoDrop 2000C, diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C. 2. Cas12a reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with the crRNA (0.5 !M) purified in step 1, a Cas12a (0.25 !M), a target single-stranded DNA (target-T1-R) (0.01 !M), a fluorescence 15 probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1, i.e., a 12 nt single-stranded DNA that is labeled with HEX at the 5™ terminal and with the BHQ1 at the 3™ terminal) (0.5 !M), a buffer solution of NEB buffer 3.1, and 0.5 !L of an RNase inhibitor. The control reaction was a reaction in which all other components were added except the single-stranded DNA target sequence. Reaction was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, and then terminated at 98°C for 2 min. 20 3. Fluorescence detection: 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well plate, and then detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission light at 556 nm). As shown in FIG. 12, different Cas12as have different detection effects on the target. For example, for HkCas12a, etc., cleavage of the probe was caused even when no target single-stranded DNA was added. FnCas12a and the like are better candidates of Cas12a proteins 25 because the cleavage of the probe occurred only when the target single-stranded DNA was added. Example 3 Cas12a protein detection capable of detecting a double-stranded DNA target 22 A double-strand DNA (target-T1) was selected as a target sequence to test the response values of its detection by different Cas12a proteins. 1. Preparation of crRNA: first, a transcription template was prepared by annealing T7-crRNA-F to a synthesized oligonucleotide T7-T1-24-R (Table 5). Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (4 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then 5 subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for about 16 h). Then RNA was purified using the RNA purification and concentration kit, quantified with NanoDrop 2000C, diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator 10 at -80°C. 2. Cas12a reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with the crRNA (0.5 !M) purified in step 1, a Cas12a (0.25 !M), a target double-stranded DNA (target-T1, obtained by annealing primers target-T1-F to target-T1-R) (0.01 !M), a fluorescence probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1) (0.5 !M), a buffer solution of NEB buffer 3.1, and 0.5 !L of an RNase inhibitor. Reaction was conducted at 15 37°C for 15 min, and then terminated at 98°C for 2 min. 3. Fluorescence detection: 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well plate, and then detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission light at 556 nm). As shown in FIG. 7, different Cas12as have different detection effects on the target. LbCas12a and the like are better candidates of Cas12a proteins because the cleavage of the 20 probe occurred only when the target double-stranded DNA was added. Example 4 Testing of different concentrations of the target with FnCas12a and LbCas12a target-T1 was selected as the target DNA, and then diluted to different concentrations at a gradient to test the response sensitivity of FnCas12a and LbCas12a thereto. In order to increase the sensitivity, a PCR amplification step was added. 25 1. Preparation of crRNA: first, a transcription template was prepared by annealing T7-crRNA-F to a synthesized oligonucleotide T7-T1-24-R (Table 5). Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide 23 (4 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for about 16 h). Then RNA was purified using the RNA purification and concentration kit, 5 quantified with NanoDrop 2000C, diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C. 2. PCR amplification (optional): a plasmid containing the target target-T1 (pUC18-T1) was used as the template, diluted at a gradient, and then used for the PCR reaction. The total volume of each reaction system was 20 !L, 0.25 !M of M13F-47 and M13R-48 each were used as primers 10 (Table 4), and a high fidelity enzyme KOD FX (ToYoBo) was used for the PCR reaction. The PCR reaction procedure was 95°C for 2 min, and then starting 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 10 s. After completion of the PCR, the PCR amplification product was directly used for a Cas12a reaction. 3. Cas12a reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with the crRNA (0.5 !M) purified in 15 step 1, FnCas12a or LbCas12a (0.25 !M), 1 !L of a PCR product (or target DNAs that are directly diluted into different concentrations), a fluorescent probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1) (0.5 !M), a buffer solution of NEB buffer 3.1, and 0.5 !L of a RNase inhibitor. Reaction was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, and then terminated at 98°C for 2 min. 4. Fluorescence detection: 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well 20 plate, and then detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission light at 556 nm). As shown in FIG. 9, when the test target was directly added, all the target DNAs with a concentration above 0.1 nM could respond, and the response was remarkable when the concentration was above 1 nM. If a PCR technology was combined, i.e., amplification of the fragment of interest through PCR followed by a Cas12a cleavage reaction, the response sensitivity 25 could be as low as 10 aM. Example 5 Testing of single-point mutant target with FnCas12a and LbCas12a 24 target-T1 was selected as the target, and it was subjected to single-point mutation in a PAM region and positions 1-18 respectively, so as to test response values of several crRNAs of different lengths to the wild type and the same after single-point mutation. 1. Preparation of crRNA: first, a transcription template was prepared by respectively annealing T7-crRNA-F to synthesized oligonucleotides T7-T1-24-R, T7-T1-15-R, T7-T1-16-R, T7-T1-17-5 R, and T7-T1-18-R (Table 5). Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (4 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for about 16 h). Then RNA 10 was purified using the RNA purification and concentration kit, quantified with NanoDrop 2000C, diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C. 2. PCR amplification: a plasmid containing the target target-T1 (pUC18-T1) was used as the template. The total volume of each reaction system was 20 !L, 0.25 !M of the primer M13R-48 and respective mutation primers for Target-T1-F each were used (Table 4), and a high fidelity 15 enzyme KOD FX (ToYoBo) was used for the PCR reaction. The PCR reaction procedure was 95°C for 2min, and then starting 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 10 s. After completion of the PCR, the product was directly used for a Cas12a reaction. 3. Cas12a reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with the crRNA (0.5 !M) purified in step 1, FnCas12a or LbCas12a (0.25 !M), 1 !L of a PCR product, a fluorescent probe (HEX-N12-20 BHQ1) (0.5 !M), a buffer solution of NEB buffer 3.1, and 0.5 !L of a RNase inhibitor. Reaction was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, and then terminated at 98°C for 2 min. 4. Fluorescence detection: 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well plate, and then detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission light at 556 nm). As shown in FIG. 10, when the complementary sequence of the target was a 25 crRNA of 24 nt (crRNA-24nt), the single-point mutations at the positions 8-18 were not much different from the wild type, while the fluorescence value decreased obviously after the PAM 25 mutation and the point mutation of positions 1-7. When the crRNA was truncated and the length of a paired target sequence was 18 nt, the fluorescence value of the mutation positions of 8-16 nt was obviously decreased compared with that of 24 nt; when the length was 16 nt or 17 nt, the decrease of the fluorescence value of the mutated target sequence is more obvious; and when the length was 15 nt, the fluorescence values of both the target sequence and the mutated target 5 sequence were very weak, but the fluorescence intensity of the mutated target sequence might still be higher as compared with those of other target sequences, and thus could be used for detection. Taken together, the crRNAs of 15 nt, 16 nt and 17 nt are the most suitable for SNP detection. Example 6 Testing of Escherichia coli and the like microorganisms in environmental water 10 The gyrB gene of Escherichia coli was selected as the detection target to indirectly test the concentrations of Escherichia coli and the like microorganisms in water. Taking Escherichia coli MG1655 as a positive control, the content of microorganisms in water (such as sewage and tap water) in the environment was determined. 1. Preparation of crRNA: first, a transcription template was prepared by annealing T7-crRNA-15 F to a synthesized oligonucleotide T7-crRNA-gyrB (Table 5). Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (4 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight 20 at 37°C (for about 16 h). Then RNA was purified using the RNA purification and concentration kit, quantified with NanoDrop 2000C, diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C. 2. PCR amplification: when the positive control sample Escherichia coli MG1655 was cultured until the OD600 was about 0.5, it was diluted at a 10-fold gradient respectively, and then used as 25 the template, and the sample was ambient water (including tap water and muddy water in the environment). The total volume of each reaction system was 20 !L, 0.25 !M of primers gyrB-F 26 and gyrB-R each were used (Table 4), and a high fidelity enzyme KOD FX (ToYoBo) was used for the PCR reaction. The PCR reaction procedure was 95°C for 2 min, and then starting 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 10 s. After completion of the PCR, the PCR product was directly used for a Cas12a reaction. 3. Cas12a reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with the crRNA (0. 5 !M) purified in 5 step 1, LbCas12a (0.25 !M), 1 !L of a PCR product, a fluorescence probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1) (0.5 !M), a buffer solution of NEB buffer 3.1, and 0.5 !L of an RNase inhibitor. Reaction was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, and then terminated at 98°C for 2 min . 4. Fluorescence detection: 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well plate, and then detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission 10 light at 556 nm). As shown in FIG. 13, the fluorescence response value of Escherichia coli MG1655 decreases with the concentration decrease. Among them, microorganisms were detected more obviously in samples 2, 4, 5 and 6. Example 7 Testing of Human SNP The SNP test selected 5 sites of human SNP, namely rs5082, rs1467558, rs2952768, 15 rs4363657, and rs601338, to test the feasibility of the HOLMES method. 1. Preparation of crRNA: first, a transcription template was prepared by annealing T7-crRNA-F to a synthesized oligonucleotide (Table 5). Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (4 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for about 16 h). RNA was purified using the RNA Clean &ConcentratorŽ-5 (Zymo Research), quantified with NanoDrop 2000C, diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C. 2. PCR amplification: the total volume of the reaction system was 20 !L, 0.25 !M of primers 25 each were used (table 4), 1 ng of a human genome (HEK293T) or directly-scraped oral epithelial mucosa was used as the template, and a high fidelity enzyme KOD FX (ToYoBo) was used for the 27 PCR reaction. The PCR reaction procedure was 95°C for 2 min, and then starting 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 10 s. After completion of the PCR, the product was directly used for a Cas12a reaction. (Primers 1-rs5082-F-T, 2-rs1467558-F-T, and 3-rs2952768-R-C were directly introduced to the corresponding mutation products of the SNP) 3. Cas12a reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with corresponding crRNA (1 !M), 5 LbCas12a (0.5 !M), 1 !L of a PCR product, and a fluorescent probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1) (0.5 !M). Reaction was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, and then terminated at 98°C for 2 min . 4. Fluorescence detection: 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well plate, and then detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission light at 556 nm). As shown in FIG. 14, only when the crRNA corresponded to the corresponding 10 target sequence, there would be a higher fluorescence response value, and if there was one point mutation, its response value would be greatly reduced. The genotype of the corresponding SNP could be determined by the fluorescence value, and these results were confirmed by sequencing results. Example 8 Testing of a cancer-related gene 15 A TP53 gene was selected as the test gene. TP53 gene has a nonsense mutation in a human T24 cell, which leads to inactivation of the gene. A cell with normal gene at this site (HEK293T), an individual gene and a mutant cell T24 were tested respectively. 1. Preparation of crRNA: first, a transcription template was prepared by annealing T7-crRNA-F to synthesized oligonucleotides T7-crRNA-34-TP53-T24-C-16nt and T7-crRNA-34-TP53-T24-20 G-16nt (Table 5). Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (4 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for about 16 h). RNA was purified using 25 the RNA Clean &ConcentratorŽ-5 (Zymo Research), quantified with NanoDrop 2000C, diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C. 28 2. PCR amplification: the total volume of the reaction system was 20 !L, 0.25 !M of primers 34-TP53-T24-F and 34-TP53-T24-R each were used (Table 4), 1 ng of a human genome (HEK293T, T24) or directly-scraped oral epithelial mucosa was used as the template, and a high fidelity enzyme KOD FX (ToYoBo) was used for the PCR reaction. The PCR reaction procedure was 95°C for 2 min, and then starting 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 10 s. 5 After completion of the PCR, the product was directly used for a Cas12a reaction. 3. Cas12a reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with corresponding crRNA (1 !M), LbCas12a (0.5 !M), 1 !L of a PCR product, and a fluorescent probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1) (0.5 !M). Reaction was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, and then terminated at 98°C for 2 min . 4. Fluorescence detection: 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well 10 plate, and then detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nM and an emission light at 556 nM). As shown in FIG. 15, when the TP53 gene that was normal at this site was the template, the detected value of crRNA-C was significantly higher than that of crRNA-G, while the crRNA-G of the mutant cell T24 was significantly increased. Example 9 Testing of Human SNP (Gout-Related Genes) 15 The SNP test selected 5 sites of human SNP that were related to a gout risk, namely rs1014290, rs6449213, rs737267, rs1260326, and rs642803, to test the HOLMES method. 1. Preparation of crRNA: first, a transcription template was prepared by annealing T7-crRNA-F to a synthesized oligonucleotide (Table 5). Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (4 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then subjected to 20 an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for about 16 h). RNA was purified using the RNA Clean &ConcentratorTM-5 (Zymo Research), quantified with NanoDrop 2000C, diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C. 25 2.

The PCR reaction procedure was 95°C for 2 min, and then starting 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 10 s. After completion of the PCR, the product was directly used for a Cas12a reaction. (Primers 1-rs5082-F-T, 2-rs1467558-F-T, and 3-rs2952768-R-C were directly introduced to the corresponding mutation products of the SNP) 5 3. Cas12a reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with the corresponding crRNA (1 !M), LbCas12a (0.5 !M), 1 !L of a PCR product, and a fluorescence probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1) (0.5 !M). Reaction was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, and then terminated at 98°C for 2 min . 4. Fluorescence detection: 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well plate, and then detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission 10 light at 556 nm). As shown in FIG. 16, only when the crRNA corresponded to the corresponding target sequence, there would be a higher fluorescence response value, and if there was one point mutation, its response value would be greatly reduced. The genotype of the corresponding SNP could be determined by the fluorescence value, and these results were confirmed by sequencing results. 15 Example 10 SNP Testing of clinical samples of volunteers (a gout related gene) by a kit A pre-mixed solution was added into a 96-well plate to prepare a kit, and then the kit was added with genomic DNAs of 21 volunteers to test the rs1014290 site, which was related to a gout risk. 1. Preparation of a kit: first, a transcription template was prepared by annealing T7-crRNA-F to a synthesized oligonucleotide (Table 5). Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (4 !M) was 20 annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 50 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. crRNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit, and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for about 16 h). RNA was purified using the RNA Clean &ConcentratorTM-5 (Zymo Research), quantified with 25 NanoDrop 2000C, and diluted to a concentration of 10 !M. 2. Pre-mixing in a 96-well plate for PCR: a 19 !L system was added with reagents required for 30 a PCR reaction, the primers being 41-rs1014290-F and 41-rs1014290-R. 3.

Fluorescence detection: it was detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission light at 556 nm). As shown in FIG. 17, because a population with a genotype A:A had a higher risk of gout, people other than volunteers Nos. 5, 7 and 9 are of the genotype A:G or G:G, so more attention should be paid to the risk of gout.

In the plasmid, a T7 promoter and a template DNA sequence for transcription of the guide RNA were inserted on the pUC18 (Note: the guide RNA transcribed from this template 15 targeted a sequence called T1 in this study). The method was firstly carrying out a round of PCR by using the pUC18 plasmid as a template and PUC18-1-F and pUC18-1-R as primers; linking PCR products with a T4 DNA Ligase, transforming the product into DH10b, and sequencing to obtain the correct clone, which was called pUC18-guide RNA-T1-pre. Then, a second round of PCR was carried out by using the pUC18-guide RNA-T1-pre as a template and pUC18-2-F and 20 pUC18-2-R as primers, linking and transforming the PCR products in the same way, to finally obtain the plasmid pUC18-guide RNA-T1 which was correct as sequenced. Next, by using the plasmid pUC18-guide RNA-T1 as a template, a guide RNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit (Thermo), and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for 12-16 h). 25 Finally, the transcription system was added with a DNase I (2 !L of the DNase I was added per 50 !L of the transcription system), subjected to a water bath at 37°C for 30 min to eliminate a 34 plasmid DNA, and the RNA was purified using the RNA purification and concentration kit, quantified with the NanoDrop 2000C, diluted to a concentration of 10 !M, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C for later use. 2. Preparation of a Target DNA (1) If the target DNA was a single strand, a 66 bp long oligonucleotide was directly synthesized 5 as the target DNA (target-T1-R), which contained the 20 bp target sequence (T1) recognized by the guide RNA. (2) If the target DNA was double-stranded, two 66 bp long complementary oligonucleotides (target-T1-F; target-T1-R) were directly synthesized, which contained the 20 bp target sequence (T1) identified by the guide RNA. The two oligonucleotides were annealed to obtain a short target 10 DNA. Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (1 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 20 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: initially denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. 3. Cas12b reaction 15 (1) annealing of the guide RNA: the guide RNA was diluted to an appropriate concentration (10 !M), and annealed in the PCR instrument. The annealing procedure: denaturing at 75°C for 5 min, and then cooling from 75°C to 20°C at a decreasing rate of 1°C per minute. (2) incubation of the guide RNA with C2c1: the annealed guide RNA was mixed with C2c1 at an equal molar concentration, and allowed to stand at 30°C for 20-30 min. 20 (3) Cas12b reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with a mixture of the guide RNA and C2c1 incubated in step (2) (the final concentrations of them were both 250 !M or 500 !M), a target DNA (with a final concentration of 50 nM), a FAM-labeled oligonucleotide (target-DNMT1-3-R-FAM-5\\') or a fluorescence quenching probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1 with the final concentration of 500 nM), 2 !L of a 10 X NEB Buffer 3.1, and 0.5 !L of an RNase inhibitor (40 U/!L). After mixing 25 homogeneously, the reaction was conducted at 48°C for 30 min. After that, it was inactivated by heating at 98°C for 5 min in a PCR instrument. 35 4. Detection of trans-cleavage activity of Cas12b by urea-denatured gel electrophoresis: 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was separated by a urea-denatured gel electrophoresis method, and then imaged by a fluorescence imaging system ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini (GE Healthcare). The results were as shown in FIG. 22. 5. Detection of trans-cleavage activity of Cas12b by a fluorescence microplate reader method: 5 20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well plate, and detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission light at 556 nm). The results were as shown in FIG. 23. Example 15: Sensitivity testing of a Cas12b reaction (trans-cleavage) By detecting the excited fluorescence intensity of the fluorescence probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1), 10 the target DNA concentration required for Cas12b to exert the trans-cleavage activity, i.e., the sensitivity of a Cas12b trans-cleavage reaction, was determined. 1. Preparation of a guide RNA Firstly, by using the pUC18-guide RNA-T1 as a template and guide RNA-DNMT1-3-F and guide RNA-DNMT1-3-R as primers, 20 bases of the guide RNA that target the target DNA of T1 15 were replaced by a guide RNA targeting DNMT1-3 through PCR, so as to obtain another plasmid pUC18-guide RNA-DNMT1-3. Then, by using the plasmid pUC18-guide RNA-DNMT1-3 as a template, a guide RNA was synthesized using a T7 high-throughput transcription kit (Thermo), and the reaction was carried out overnight at 37°C (for 12-16 h). 20 Finally, the transcription system was added with a DNase I (2 !L of the DNase I was added per 50 !L of the transcription system), subjected to a water bath at 37°C for 30min to eliminate a plasmid DNA, and the RNA was purified using the RNA purification and concentration kit, quantified with the NanoDrop 2000C, and stored in a refrigerator at -80°C for later use. 2. Preparation of a Target DNA 25 For the target DNA, the first one is that the target DNA was directly added into a Cas12b reaction system without amplification. The method was as follows: 36 (1) If the target DNA was a single strand, a 50 bp long oligonucleotide was directly synthesized as the target DNA (DNMT1-3 (TTC PAM)-R), which contained the 20 bp target sequence (DNMT1-3) recognized by the guide RNA. (2) If the target DNA was double-stranded, two 50 bp long complementary oligonucleotides (DNMT1-3 (TTC PAM)-F; DNMT1-3 (TTC PAM)-R) were directly synthesized, which contained 5 the 20 bp target sequence (DNMT1-3) recognized by the guide RNA. The two oligonucleotides were annealed to obtain a short target DNA. Specifically, the paired oligonucleotide (2 !M) was annealed in a 1X PCR buffer (Transgen Biotech) at a total volume of 20 !L, and then subjected to an annealing procedure: denaturing at 95°C for 5 minutes, and then cooling from 95°C to 20°C at a rate of 1°C per minute using a thermal cycler. 10 (3) the single-stranded or double-stranded target DNA was diluted at a gradient to 2 !M, 0.2 !M, 0.02 !M, 0.002 !M and 0.0002 !M for later use. The second one was inserting a fragment containing the target sequence (DNMT1-3) into a plasmid vector for amplification by the LAMP reaction. (1) the fragment containing the target sequence (DNMT1-3) was inserted into a pEasy-Blunt 15 Zero Cloning Vector using a pEasy-Blunt Zero Cloning Kit from Transgen, so as to obtain the correct clone after verified by sequencing. (2) A LAMP expansion reaction Using the above plasmid as a template, the LAMP amplification reaction was carried out. The templates were added respectively at 0 nM, 1 nM, and 0.1 nM, and diluted at a 10-fold gradient to 20 10-11 nM. The total volume of each reaction system was 25 !L, primers of 1.6 !M of  LAMP-DNM-FIP and LAMP-DNM-BIP each, 0.2 !M of LAMP-DNM-F3 and LAMP-DNM-B3 each, 0.4 !M of LAMP-DNM-LoopF and LAMP-DNM-LoopB each were used, and the kit used for the LAMP reaction was the WarmStart® LAMP Kit (NEB). The LAMP reaction procedure was 65°C for 30 min. After the LAMP was completed, inactivation was conducted at 80°C for 10 min, and 25 then the product was directly used for a Cas12b reaction. 3. Cas12b reaction 37 (1) annealing of the guide RNA: the guide RNA was diluted to an appropriate concentration (5 !M), and annealed in the PCR instrument. The annealing procedure: denaturing at 75°C for 5 min, and then cooling from 75°C to 20°C at a decreasing rate of 1°C per minute. (2) incubation of the guide RNA with Cas12b: the annealed guide RNA was mixed with Cas12b at an equal molar concentration, and allowed to stand at 30°C for 20-30 min. 5 (3) Cas12b reaction: a 20 !L reaction system was added with the mixture of the guide RNA and Cas12b incubated in step (2) (the final concentrations of the guide RNA and Cas12b were both 250 !M), 1 !L of a target DNA or 1 !L of a LAMP product, a fluorescence probe (HEX-N12-BHQ1) (with a final concentration of 500 nM), 2 !L of a 10X NEB Buffer 3.1, and 0.5 !L of an RNase inhibitor (40 U/!L). After mixing homogenously, the reaction was conducted at 48°C for 10 30min. After that, it was inactivated fire heating at 98°C for 5 min in a PCR instrument. 4. Detection of trans-cleavage activity of Cas12b by a fluorescence microplate reader method:  20 !L of the inactivated reaction solution was added into a 96-well plate, and detected by a microplate reader (with an excitation light at 535 nm and an emission light at 556 nm). Combined with the LAMP amplification, Cas12b could produce a significant collateral single-stranded DNA 15 trans-cleavage activity for a target DNA concentration as low as 10 aM. The results were as shown in FIG. 24. Cis-cleavage characteristics of Cas12a in cleaving a target single-stranded DNA: First, in order to test the single-stranded DNA cleavage characteristics of Cas12a, several crRNAs targeting a short single-stranded DNA (DNMT1-3) (Table 1) are designed, which are 20 labeled with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 3\\' terminal. After the cleavage by FnCas12a, the reaction product is analyzed by denatured urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-PAGE). It is found that the single strand DNA cleavage by Cas12a is programmed. That is, the cleavage site is near the 22nd base (21st to 23rd bases) of the target sequence counted from the 3\\' end base to the 5\\' end of the first target sequence paired with the crRNA guide sequence, as shown 25 in FIGs. 1A and 1C. The cleavage of a double-stranded DNA by Cas12a requires a PAM sequence, while the cleavage of a single-stranded DNA by Cas12a does not require the PAM sequence (FIGs. 38 1A, 1B and 2), which is similar to the single-stranded DNA cleavage mediated by Cas9. However, the single-stranded DNA cleavage activity mediated by Cas12a depends on a stem-loop structure in crRNA, as shown in FIG. 1A, while Cas9 still shows weak cleavage activity for a single-stranded DNA with  only a 20-nt complementary RNA sequence. The stem-loop structure of the crRNA is important for stabilizing the structure of Cas12a, which is the reason why the ring 5 structure of the crRNA is necessary for the cleavage of the single-stranded DNA by Cas12a. It is further tested whether a shorter lead sequence crRNA can pass through the single-stranded DNA cleavage site of Cas12a in such a manner that the cleavage is outside the recognition site. When the length of the guide sequence is 16 nt, 18 nt and 20 nt, all of these crRNAs lead to cleavage by Cpf1 near the 22nd base, as shown in FIGs. 1B and 1D, meaning that the cleavage site is 4 nt, 2 nt 10 or 0 nt outside the recognition site. Next, the cleavage efficiency of Cas12a on different substrates is tested by using substrates of a double-stranded DNA and a single-stranded DNA respectively, as shown in FIG. 1F. Similar to the situation of Cas9 cleavage, the cleavage of the single-stranded DNA is slower than that of the double-stranded DNA, as shown in FIGs. 1E to 1G. These results indicate that the mechanism of recognizing and cleaving a single-stranded DNA by Cas12a may 15 be different from that of a double-stranded DNA, which is a low-efficiency recognition and cleavage manner independent of PAM; and the PAM sequence accelerates the recognition and/or cleavage of the target double-stranded DNA by Cas12a. Trans-cleavage characteristics of Cas12a in cleaving a single-stranded DNA: When the target single-stranded DNA is labeled at the 3\\' terminal, Cas12a cleaves at the 20 vicinity of the 22nd base, as shown in FIG. 1. However, when it is labeled at the 5\\' terminal, no cleavage product band of predicted size is observed, but a short (< 6 nt) FAM-labeled product is produced, as shown in FIG. 3B. Through detailed experiments, once the ternary complex Cas12a/crRNA/target single-stranded DNA is formed, the target single-stranded DNA (DNMT1-3) (Table 1) labeled at 5\\'-terminal is cleaved, and a short FAM-labeled product is produced, as 25 shown in FIG. 3C. In addition, the ternary complex also cleaves a single-stranded DNA that has no sequence that is complementary with the crRNA (i.e., a collateral single-stranded DNA) in any 39 other reaction system, as shown in FIGs. 3C and 3D. This cleavage phenomenon is called trans-cleavage, which is different from programmable cis-cleavage. When the target single-stranded DNA is labeled at the 3™ terminal, trans-cleavage is also observed, but many cis-cleavage products are left, as shown in FIG. 3B, This may be due to the complex formed by Cas12a/crRNA/target single-stranded DNA, and the target single-stranded DNA is protected, such that its labeled 3™ 5 terminal is protected from exposure to a nuclease active site of the ternary complex. These cleavage processes can be as shown in FIG. 3A. In addition to the FnCas12a tested above, 9 Cas12as from other species sources are also tested (Table 2 and FIG. 4A). Except Lb4Cas12a, all Cas12as have good endonuclease activity to the plasmid DNA (as shown in FIG. 4B), and all Cas12a ternary complexes show cis and trans cleavage 10 activities on the single strand (as shown in FIGs. 4C and 4D). This shows that cis and trans activity of Cas12a on the single-stranded DNA is a common phenomenon. The cis and trans key sites and mechanism for cleaving a single-stranded DNA by Cas12a. In order to determine the key amino acid residues related to cis and trans activities on the single-stranded DNA in Cas12a, several candidate residues of Cas12a are mutated to conduct the 15 activity test. First, three single-amino-acid mutants of FnCas12a (H843A, K852A and K869A) are purified and tested, and their residues are related to an RNase activity. The results of the study of the trans-activity on the single-stranded DNA show that no obvious difference in cis- and trans-cleavage activities on the single-stranded DNA between the wild-type FnCas12a and the three mutants is found, as shown in FIGs. 5A and 5C. 20 Next, when endonuclease active sites in the FnCas12a, i.e., the RuvC domain (D917A, E1006A or D1255A) and the Nuc domain (R1218A) sites are mutated, the cis and trans cleavage activities of these mutated Cas12a on the single-stranded DNA are both affected, as shown in FIGs. 5B and 5D. These results indicate that the key site of Cas12a for cleavage of a target double-stranded DNA is closely related to cis and trans cleavage activities on the single-stranded DNA. 25 40 Recent structural studies of Cas12b (i.e., C2c1) (including complexes with an extended target DNA or an extended non-target DNA) show that both strands are located in an RuvC pocket, as shown in FIGs. 6A and 6B. By comparing the endonuclease catalytic residues of Cas12b (i.e. C2c1) and Cas12a, these sites are most likely to play similar roles in the cleavage and functions of Cas12b (i.e., C2c1) and Cas12a. The results of an in vitro single amino acid mutation experiment 5 show that it is consistent with the above hypothesis. That is, Cas12a is likely to cleave two strands through only one RuvC catalytic pocket. The trans-cleavage activity of a Cas12a complex: in the structure of a complex of Cas12b (i.e., C2c1) with an additional single-stranded DNA, a sequence-independent single-stranded DNA is also located on the surface of a catalytic pocket, as shown in FIG. 6C, which is similar to that of a 10 collateral single-stranded DNA substrate in Cas12a. Combined with a single-amino-acid mutation experiment, it is proposed that the target DNA, non-target DNA and collateral single-stranded DNA are all cleaved in the single RuvC pocket in Cas12a, as shown in FIGs. 6D, 6E and 6F. The ternary Cas12a complex has a collateral single-stranded DNA trans-cleavage activity, while the reason why a monomer or a binary complex does not have the collateral single-stranded DNA 15 trans-cleavage activity can be explained by comparing the structures of the monomer, binary and ternary complexes. The structure of a monomer Cas12a is disordered, the binary complex Cas12a/crRNA has a triangular structure, as shown in FIG. 6G, while the ternary complex Cas12a/crRNA/target DNA is converted into a double-leaf structure, thus exposing the catalytic pocket to realize trans-cleavage of the collateral single-stranded DNA (as shown in FIG. 6H). 20 Establishment of a nucleic acid detection method Based on the characteristics of Cas12a, a specific nucleic acid molecule detection method was developed, which was called HOLMES (one HOur Low-cost Multipurpose Efficient Simple assay). Just like the name of the technology, it was characterized by a simple test method that is one hour and has low cost, multiple uses and high efficiency. 25 41 In the whole reaction system, the method can be divided into two major steps, one is the amplification of a template nucleic acid, and the other is the specific nucleic acid detection by a Cas12a protein. Here, a PCR method is used for nucleic acid amplification, but in fact, any amplification method can be combined with the nucleic acid detection in the second step, such as the isothermal amplification method RPA, etc. The initial nucleic acid is not limited to a double-5 stranded DNA, but may also be a single-stranded DNA; or even an RNA still can be detected after reverse transcription, so this method is suitable for various types of nucleic acid molecules. For the nucleic acid detection phase, three components are the keys to the experiment, namely Cas12a, crRNA and a nucleic acid probe. In addition to the 10 Cas12as mentioned in the example (these 10 proteins are randomly selected), other Cas12a proteins are also suitable for this method. In 10 addition, other types of Cas proteins (e.g., a C2c1 protein) are also suitable for the claimed scope of the present invention: as shown by the experimental results, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris Cas12b (i.e., C2c1) also has a collateral single-stranded DNA trans-cleavage activity similar to that of Cas12a, and its complex with crRNA/target DNA can also cleave a collateral single-stranded DNA. 15 For crRNA serving as a guide, it will be more stable in the system after being engineered, for example being modified manually. With regard to the selection of nucleic acid probes, the present invention selects a short single-stranded DNA labeled with HEX and BHQ1, and any other detectable labeling method is theoretically applicable, as long as the nucleic acid probe is cleaved to produce detectable differences. Alternatively, the nucleic acid probe can also be designed to 20 fluoresce after binding to a compound, so as to detect whether the probe is cleaved.

       "' 1  USE OF CAS PROTEIN, METHOD FOR DETECTING TARGET NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULE, AND KIT TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention belongs to the field of biotechnology, and in particular to a method for 5 detecting a target nucleic acid molecule. BACKGROUND A specific nucleic acid detection method has an important application value, such as pathogen detection, genetic disease detection, etc. In an aspect of pathogen detection, since each pathogen microorganism has its unique characteristic nucleic acid molecular sequence, it is possible to 10 develop nucleic acid molecular detection for specific species, also known as nucleic acid diagnostic (NAD), which is of great significance in the fields of food safety, environmental microorganism pollution detection, human pathogen infection, etc. Another aspect is the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in human or other species. Understanding the relationship between a genetic variation and a biological function at the genomic level provides a new 15 perspective for modern molecular biology. SNP is closely related to biological functions, evolution and diseases, so the development of SNP detection and analysis technologies is particularly important. At present, many NAD methods have been established, mainly for the detection of a specific DNA molecule, and there are also some methods for RNA molecules. Generally speaking, a DNA 20 molecule is very stable, so a test sample can come from a series of complex biological samples; while RNA is very easy to degrade, so it needs to be handled with great care. In the 1970s, a detection method using restriction endonuclease digestion was established. Later, methods such as Southern, Northern and dot blot hybridization were developed for specific detection of a nucleic acid molecule. In 1985, when PCR became a conventional experimental method, it led to an 25 exponential improvement in molecular biology. Currently established specific nucleic acid molecule detection usually needs to be performed in two steps, the first step being the amplification   2 of a target nucleic acid and the second step being the detection of the target nucleic acid. PCR technology is an amplification method that is first established and most commonly used at present. Currently, based on the PCR method, a fluorescent-labeled probe is introduced, such that the amplification situation of a target can be detected in real time, which is called Realtime PCR. The Realtime PCR is not only a fast and highly-sensitive detection method, but also a method for 5 quantitative analysis. In addition to the PCR amplification method, many alternative methods have been established, such as ligase chain reaction, branched DNA amplification, NASBA, SDA, transcription-mediated amplification, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), rolling circle amplification (RCA), Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA), etc. The advantage of many of these alternative methods is isothermality. That is to say, only one temperature is needed 10 to complete the reaction, without the need for a thermal cycling instrument like that used in PCR. Among nucleic acid detection methods, besides the Realtime PCR that can directly complete amplification and detection, the FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization) technology is the most commonly-used detection method - a method in which a labeled molecular probe is in situ hybridized with a complementary target sequence. In addition, detection methods such as next-15 generation sequencing technologies and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies have also been developed, but these methods usually require expensive experimental equipment. The detection of SNPs also first requires amplification by a method such as PCR and the like, so as to obtain sufficient SNP site-containing region fragments for further detection. Commonly used methods include: primer extension, hybridization, ligation, and enzymatic cleavage. When 20 the above methods are completed, a specific method needs to be utilized for detection, such as mass spectrometry detection, fluorescence detection, chemiluminescence detection, etc. Although many detection methods have been developed for nucleic acid detection as described above, in certain cases, how to detect more quickly, simply and less expensively is still an important development direction, such as rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria in the field, rapid 25 detection of drug-sensitive SNPs, etc. In 2016, Collins et al. developed a rapid and inexpensive method for detecting the Zika virus based on the characteristic of CRISPR-Cas9 of specifically '"

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to methods of making benzoxazepin oxazolidinone compounds, 10 and useful intermediates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The PI3 kinase/Akt/PTEN pathway is an attractive target for cancer drug development since such agents would be expected to inhibit cellular proliferation, to repress signals from stromal cells that provide for survival and chemoresistance of cancer cells, to reverse the 15 repression of apoptosis and surmount intrinsic resistance of cancer cells to cytotoxic agents. PI3K is activated through receptor tyrosine kinase signaling as well as activating mutations in the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, or through rare activating mutations in AKT. Benzoxazepin compounds have potent and selective activity as inhibitors of the PI3K 20 alpha isoform. Taselisib (GDC-0032, Roche RG7604, CAS Reg. No. 1282512-48-4, Genentech Inc.), named as 2-(4-(2-(1-isopropy1-3-methy1-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-y1)-5,6-dihydrobenzo [f]imidazo [1,2-d] [1,4] oxazepin-9-y1)-1H-pyrazol-1-y1)-2-methylpropanamide, has potent PI3K activity (Ndubaku, C. 0. et al (2013) J. Med. Chem. 56:4597-4610; WO 2011/036280; US 8242104; US 8343955) and is being studied in patients with locally 25 advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Taselisib (GDC-0032) is a beta-isoform sparing inhibitor of the PI3K catalytic subunit, 31x more selective for the alpha subunit, compared to beta. Taselisib displays greater selectivity for mutant PI3Ka isoforms than wild-type PI3Ka (Olivero AG et al, AACR 2013. Abstract DDT02-01). Taselisib is currently being developed as a treatment for patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative 30 metastatic breast cancer (mBC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There is a need for 1  N NH2  WO 2018/109204 PCT/EP2017/083143 new selective inhibitors of mutant PI3Kct isoforms.

Patent Literature 1 describes to provide a first metal on a central portion of a semiconductor and forming a Schottky contact of a second metal and the semiconductor at a peripheral portion of the semiconductor.

       " ['1  PROCESS FOR CONTROLLING THE ORIENTATION OF THE NANODOMAINS OF A BLOCK COPOLYMER  [Field of the invention] [0001] The present invention relates to the field of the control of the orientation of the nanodomains of a block copolymer, which are generated during the 5 nanostructuring of the said block copolymer. This orientation depends in particular on the surface energy at each interface of the block copolymer. [0002] More particularly, the invention relates to a process for controlling the orientation of the nanodomains of a block copolymer, the upper interface of which is in contact with a compound, or mixture of compounds, in the liquid or solid form. In 10 addition, the invention relates to a process for the manufacture of a nanolithography resist starting from a block copolymer, the said process comprising the stages of the process for controlling the orientation of the blocks of the said block copolymer.  [Prior art] [0003] The development of nanotechnologies has made it possible to constantly 15 miniaturize products in the field of microelectronics and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) in particular. At the current time, conventional lithography techniques no longer make it possible to meet these constant needs for miniaturization, as they do not make it possible to produce structures with dimensions of less than 60 nm.  20 [0004] It has therefore been necessary to adapt the lithography techniques and to create etching resists which make it possible to create increasingly small patterns with a high resolution. With block copolymers, it is possible to structure the arrangement of the constituent blocks of the copolymers by phase segregation between the blocks, thus forming nanodomains, at scales of less than 50 nm. Due to this ability to be 25 nanostructured, the use of block copolymers in the fields of electronics or optoelectronics is now well known. [0005] However, the block copolymers intended to form nanolithography resists have to exhibit nanodomains oriented perpendicularly to the surface of the substrate, in order to be able subsequently to selectively remove one of the blocks of the block 30 copolymer and to create a porous film with the residual block(s). The patterns thus  2  created in the porous film can subsequently be transferred, by etching, to an underlying substrate.  [0006] The surface energy (denoted x) of a given material \"x\" is defined as being the excess energy at the surface of the material in comparison with that of the material within its body. When the material is in the liquid form, its surface energy is 5 equivalent to its surface tension. [0007] Each of the blocks i, – j of a block copolymer exhibits a surface energy, denoted i– j, which is specific to it and which depends on its chemical constituents, that is to say on the chemical nature of the monomers or comonomers of which it is composed. Likewise, each of the constituent materials of a substrate exhibits its own 10 surface energy value. [0008] Each of the blocks i, – j of the block copolymer exhibits, in addition, an interaction parameter of Flory-Huggins type, denoted: ix, when it interacts with a given material \"x\", which can be a liquid, a solid surface or another polymer phase, for example, and an interfacial energy denoted \"ix\", with ix = i-(x cos ix), where ix is 15 the contact angle between the materials i and x. The interaction parameter between two blocks i and j of the block copolymer is thus denoted ij.  [0009] Jia et al., Journal of Macromolecular Science, B, 2011, 50, 1042, have shown that there exists a relationship connecting the surface energy i and the Hildebrand solubility parameter i of a given material i. In fact, the Flory-Huggins 20 interaction parameter between two given materials i and x is indirectly related to the surface energies i and x specific to the materials. The physical phenomenon of interaction appearing at the interface of the materials is thus described either in terms of surface energies or in terms of interaction parameter. [0010] In order to obtain a structuring of the constituent nanodomains of a block 25 copolymer which is perfectly perpendicular with respect to the underlying substrate, it thus appears necessary to precisely control the interactions of the block copolymer with the different interfaces with which it is physically in contact. In general, the block copolymer is in contact with two interfaces: an interface referred to as \"lower\" in the continuation of the description, in contact with the underlying substrate, and an 30 interface referred to as \"upper\", in contact with another compound or mixture of compounds. In general, the compound or mixture of compounds at the upper interface is composed of ambient air or of an atmosphere of controlled composition. ',\n",

       " [' 1  USE OF CAS PROTEIN, METHOD FOR DETECTING TARGET NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULE, AND KIT TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention belongs to the field of biotechnology, and in particular to a method for 5 detecting a target nucleic acid molecule. BACKGROUND A specific nucleic acid detection method has an important application value, such as pathogen detection, genetic disease detection, etc. In an aspect of pathogen detection, since each pathogen microorganism has its unique characteristic nucleic acid molecular sequence, it is possible to 10 develop nucleic acid molecular detection for specific species, also known as nucleic acid diagnostic (NAD), which is of great significance in the fields of food safety, environmental microorganism pollution detection, human pathogen infection, etc. Another aspect is the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in human or other species. Understanding the relationship between a genetic variation and a biological function at the genomic level provides a new 15 perspective for modern molecular biology. SNP is closely related to biological functions, evolution and diseases, so the development of SNP detection and analysis technologies is particularly important. At present, many NAD methods have been established, mainly for the detection of a specific DNA molecule, and there are also some methods for RNA molecules. Generally speaking, a DNA 20 molecule is very stable, so a test sample can come from a series of complex biological samples; while RNA is very easy to degrade, so it needs to be handled with great care. In the 1970s, a detection method using restriction endonuclease digestion was established. Later, methods such as Southern, Northern and dot blot hybridization were developed for specific detection of a nucleic acid molecule. In 1985, when PCR became a conventional experimental method, it led to an 25 exponential improvement in molecular biology. Currently established specific nucleic acid molecule detection usually needs to be performed in two steps, the first step being the amplification   2 of a target nucleic acid and the second step being the detection of the target nucleic acid. PCR technology is an amplification method that is first established and most commonly used at present. Currently, based on the PCR method, a fluorescent-labeled probe is introduced, such that the amplification situation of a target can be detected in real time, which is called Realtime PCR. The Realtime PCR is not only a fast and highly-sensitive detection method, but also a method for 5 quantitative analysis. In addition to the PCR amplification method, many alternative methods have been established, such as ligase chain reaction, branched DNA amplification, NASBA, SDA, transcription-mediated amplification, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), rolling circle amplification (RCA), Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA), etc. The advantage of many of these alternative methods is isothermality. That is to say, only one temperature is needed 10 to complete the reaction, without the need for a thermal cycling instrument like that used in PCR. Among nucleic acid detection methods, besides the Realtime PCR that can directly complete amplification and detection, the FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization) technology is the most commonly-used detection method - a method in which a labeled molecular probe is in situ hybridized with a complementary target sequence. In addition, detection methods such as next-15 generation sequencing technologies and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies have also been developed, but these methods usually require expensive experimental equipment. The detection of SNPs also first requires amplification by a method such as PCR and the like, so as to obtain sufficient SNP site-containing region fragments for further detection. Commonly used methods include: primer extension, hybridization, ligation, and enzymatic cleavage. When 20 the above methods are completed, a specific method needs to be utilized for detection, such as mass spectrometry detection, fluorescence detection, chemiluminescence detection, etc. Although many detection methods have been developed for nucleic acid detection as described above, in certain cases, how to detect more quickly, simply and less expensively is still an important development direction, such as rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria in the field, rapid 25 detection of drug-sensitive SNPs, etc. In 2016, Collins et al. developed a rapid and inexpensive method for detecting the Zika virus based on the characteristic of CRISPR-Cas9 of specifically ',\n",

[Background Art] Although making up a very small proportion in animal tissues, mineral components such as zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), etc., perform various physiological functions such as forming a skeleton, regulating osmotic pressure in the body, maintaining acid-base equilibrium of body fluids, being involved in the activity as an active agent of the enzymatic system or as a component of enzymes themselves, etc. For example, zinc is an essential material for the growth of livestock and contributes to boosting immunity. Since such mineral components including zinc cannot be synthesized in the body, proper supply from the outside is necessary, and in the case of livestock, they are provided by combining these ingredients in feeds. However, when minerals are ingested in the inorganic form, such as metal oxides or metal salts, dissociated metal elements can form complexes with other elements competitively, and thus, there is a disadvantage that absorption is inhibited. Therefore, inorganic trace minerals are being supplied in excess of actual livestock demands, and excess minerals that are not absorbed by living organisms are excreted in powder and are reduced to soil, causing deep soil contamination. Therefore, in recent years, the supply of inorganic trace minerals has been limited, such as establishing a legal limit of mineral contents in feed to prevent heavy metal pollution in the environment. As such, the use of organic trace minerals has been suggested as an alternative, because the absorption rate is high even with using a low amount, which can satisfy the metabolic capacity and reduce the excretion amount. Representative product groups of such organic trace minerals are amino acid-metal complexes and amino acid-metal chelates. Studies are in progress on amino acid-metal chelates, which have relatively high absorption rates in the body. 1  For example, there are a preparation method of methionine-zinc chelate by mixing methionine with zinc chloride and then adding NaOH (US Patent No. 7,087,775), a preparation method of methionine-zinc chelate by simultaneously reacting methionine with calcium hydroxide and sulfur zinc sulfate (US Patent No. 6,710,079), a preparation method of methionine-mineral chelate by mixing a methionine solution and a mineral solution to which a basic substance is added (Korean Patent No. 10-0583274), a preparation method of yeast-mineral chelate by using a yeast liquid and mineral sulfate (Korean Patent No. 10-0860778), a preparation method of methionine-iron chelate by reacting an inorganic iron solution and a methionine solution at a predetermined temperature and pH (Korean Patent No. 10-0509141), etc. However, ions present in the metal salts used in these methods, such as sulfate ions, etc., have a disadvantage of forming a by-product such as insoluble salts or lowering the yield by interfering with the chelate bond between methionine and the metal. [Disclosure] [Technical Problem] As a result of making intensive efforts to find ways to produce methionine-metal chelates with high efficiency, the present applicant confirmed that the preparation method of the present disclosure does not generate insoluble salts and has an effect of greatly improving the recovery rate of the desired methionine-metal chelate, and that Ca(NO3)2  which is generated as a by-product can be used as a liquid fertilizer or as a solid fertilizer after granulation, thereby completing the present disclosure. [Technical Solution] An object of the present disclosure is to provide a method for preparing a methionine-metal chelate, comprising mixing methionine and Ca(OH)2; and adding metal nitrate to the mixture to produce a methionine-metal chelate. Another object of the present disclosure is to provide a methionine-metal chelate prepared by the preparation method above. Still another object of the present disclosure is to provide a feed or a feed additive comprising the methionine-metal chelate.

TECHNICAL FIELD [2] The present invention relates to certain diaryl macrocyclic derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and methods of using them to treat cancer, pain, neurological diseases, autoimmune diseases, and inflammation. BACKGROUND [3] Protein kinases are key regulators for cell growth, proliferation and survival. Genetic and epigenetic alterations accumulate in cancer cells leading to abnormal activation of signal transduction pathways which drive malignant processes. Manning, G. et al., Science 2002, 298, 1912-1934. Pharmacological inhibition of these signaling pathways presents promising intervention opportunities for targeted cancer therapies. Sawyers, C., Nature 2004, 432, 294-297. [4] MET, along with RON, belongs to a unique subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases, and is mainly produced in cells of epithelial or endothelial origin. Park, M. et al., Cell 1986, 45, 895-904. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF), is the only known natural high-affinity ligand of MET, and is mainly expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin. Bottaro, D. P. et al., Science 1991, 25/, 802-804. HGF/MET signaling controls MET-dependent cell proliferation, survival, and migration processes that are critical for invasive growth during embryonic development and postnatal organ regeneration, and are fully active in adults only for wound healing and tissue regeneration processes. Trusolino, L. et al., Nature Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010,11, 834-848. The HGF/MET axis is frequently upregulated in many cancers through activating mutation, gene amplification, aberrant paracrine, or autocrine ligand production, and is strongly linked with tumorigenesis, invasive growth, and metastasis. Gherardi, E. et al., Nature Rev. Cancer 2012, /2, 89-103. In addition, the activation of HGF/MET signaling is emerging as an important mechanism in resistance to EGFR and BRAF inhibitor treatments via MET amplification and/or upregulation of stromal HGF. Engelman, J. 1  WO 2015/112806 PCT/US2015/012597 A. et al., Science 2007, 316, 1039-1043; Wilson, T.R. et al., Nature 2012, 487, 505-509. Due to the role of aberrant HGF/MET signaling in human oncogenesis, invasion/metastasis, and resistance, inhibition of the HGF/MET signaling pathway has great potential in cancer therapy. [5] ALK, along with leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK), is grouped within the insulin receptor (IR) superfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases. ALK is mainly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems suggesting a potential role in normal development and function of the nervous system. Pulford, K. et al., Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004, 61, 2939. ALK was first discovered as a fusion protein, NPM (nucleophosmin)-ALK, encoded by a fusion gene arising from the t(2;5)(p23;q35) chromosomal translocation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines. Morris, S.W. et al., Science 1994, 263, 1281. More than twenty distinct ALK translocation partners have been discovered in many cancers, including ALCL (60-90% incidence), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT, 50-60%), non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC, 3-7%), colorectal cancers (CRC, 0-2.4%), breast cancers (0-2.4%), and other carcinomas. Grande, E. et al., Mol. Cancer Ther. 2011, 10, 569-579. The ALK-fusion proteins are located in the cytoplasm, and the fusion partners with ALK play a role in dimerization or oligomerization of the fusion proteins through a coil-coil interaction to generate constitutive activation of ALK kinase function. Bischof, D. et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 1997, 17, 2312-2325. EML4-ALK, which comprises portions of the echinoderm microtubule associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and the ALK gene, was first discovered in NSCLC, is highly oncogenic, and was shown to cause lung adenocarcinoma in transgenic mice. Soda, M. et al., Nature 2007, 448, 561-566. Oncogenic point mutations of ALK in both familial and sporadic cases of neuroblastoma. Mosse, Y. P. et al., Nature 2008, 455, 930-935. ALK is an attractive molecular target for cancer therapeutic intervention because of the important roles in haematopoietic, solid, and mesenchymal tumors. Grande, supra. [6] The tropomyosin-related receptor tyrosine kinases (Trks) are the high-affinity receptor for neurotrophins (NTs), a nerve growth factor (NGF) family of proteins. Members of the Trk family are highly expressed in cells of neural origin. Activation of Trks (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) by their preferred neurotrophins (NGF to TrkA, brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and NT4/5 to TrkB, and NT3 to TrkC) mediates the survival and differentiation of neurons during development. The NT/Trk signaling pathway functions as an endogenous system that protects neurons after biochemical insults, transient ischemia, or physical injury. Thiele, C. J. et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 2009, 15, 5962-5967. However, Trk was originally cloned as an oncogene fused with the tropomyosin gene in the extracellular domain. The activating mutations caused by chromosomal rearrangements or mutations in NTRK1 (TrkA) has been identified in papillary and medullary thyroid carcinoma, and recently in non-small cell 2 ',\n",

SEQUENCE LISTING [0002] The instant application contains a Sequence Listing which has been filed electronically in ASCII format and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Said ASCII copy, created on October 31, 2017, is named 42363-711 601 SL.txt and is 242,369 bytes in size. BACKGROUND [0003] Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are normally found on antigen-presenting cells where they present antigen to cognate CD4+ T-cells helping to regulate immune responses. MHC class II molecules are formed by dimerization of an alpha and beta chain, and are stabilized in the presence of a polypeptide antigen that associates in a biding groove formed by the alpha and beta chain. However, production of MHC class II in engineered systems in vitro has been challenging due to the intrinsic instability of the protein heterodimers, even in the presence of a polypeptide. SUMMARY [0004] Disclosed herein are isolated and purified antigen-MHC heterodimers and efficient methods of making the same. The heterodimers are engineered to facilitate ease of production and isolation. Multiple methods are employed to increase production of isolated heterodimers. First, the alpha and beta chains are both separately fused to a portion of an IgG heavy chain, then the IgG is engineered with a knob-in-hole architecture (with one of the alpha or beta-chain IgG comprising a knob and the opposite alpha or beta-chain IgG comprising the hole). In some instances the heterodimer can be further stabilized by a cysteine trap between the antigen and a residue of the MHC class II binding groove. To employ a cysteine trap, the antigen can comprise an endogenous or engineered cysteine that forms a disulfide bond with an engineered cysteine on the alpha or beta chain of the MHC molecule that is in close proximity to the binding groove. This cysteine trap can further increase the stability of a peptide MHC molecule. Unexpectedly, the knob-in-hole architecture has been found to work in the absence of a heterologous dimerization domains that have been previously employed. In fact, a heterologous dimerization domain was found to be detrimental to formation of heterodimers. 1  [0005] Provided herein, in one aspect, are isolated heterodimers comprising at least one first polypeptide and at least one second polypeptide, wherein the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide meet at an interface, wherein the interface of the first polypeptide comprises an engineered protuberance which is positionable in an engineered cavity in the interface of the second polypeptide; and (i) the first polypeptide comprises an MHC class II al domain, an MHC class II a2 domain, or a combination thereof; and the second polypeptide comprises an MHC class II f31 domain, an MHC class II (3.2 domain, or a combination thereof; or (ii) the first polypeptide comprises an MHC class II (3.1 domain, an MHC class II (3.2 domain, or a combination thereof; and the second polypeptide comprises an MHC class II al domain, an MHC class II a2 domain, or a combination thereof.

       " ['1 METHOD FOR SEX SORTING OF MOSQUITOES AND APPARATUS THEREFOR FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  5 The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to sex sorting of mosquitoes and, more particularly, but not exclusively, to a method and apparatus for providing sorted male mosquitoes. To date, mosquito SIT (Sterile Insect Technique) has proved itself in small scale projects around the globe, as a promising and effective tool for fighting mosquito-borne diseases. The 10 idea is to release male mosquitoes with unique characteristics such that their off spring do not evolve, or the distributed males are sterile such that there will not be any offspring. Small scale pilots, in which a few million male mosquitoes were released on small area, were performed by different research institutions and companies, all demonstrated reduction in mosquito population in that area weeks after deploying the engineered male mosquitoes on a 15 weekly basis. In order to treat large areas, millions of mosquitoes are needed to be produced on a daily basis. However, the operational costs associated with the labor intensive involved in the rearing and handling process today prevent the mosquito SIT from scaling up. The specific steps in the 20 rearing process we are referring to are: 1. The sex sorting procedure. It is required to release males only, as opposed to releasing females when the target goal is to replace the local population and create a new type of mosquito population. The mosquitoes need to be sorted between females and males, and only males should be in the release boxes sent to the field for release. 25 2. The loading of the mosquitoes into the release boxes. Today, the common procedure is to place pupa (together with water) inside the release boxes. As each release box may contain in the order of 700 Š 1500 mosquitoes, the workers need to transfer the pupa from other larger containers, and measure the quantity transferred, although resolution to a single mosquito is not required. Transferring 1,000 pupa into a release box at a time when 30 millions of pupa per day are needed is highly intensive work requiring time and people. The costs are too high for large scale operations. There is on-going research to optimize the sorting process. However, most systems to date, have tried to sort while in the pupa stage (based on weight, size, color). Other attempts have involved zapping the female mosquitoes while they are adults.  2 A problem is that the adult mosquito can be very active, and thus from the moment you classified its sex until you manage to do something it may have moved or flown away. Also having other mosquitoes in the field of view may obscure the vision sensor. Sorting at the pupa, may lead to large collateral damage (meaning many dead males). 5 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  The present embodiments may use a time when adult mosquitoes are still, in order to apply imaging and then pick the wanted insects or zap the unwanted insects. Such a time may be the time when the insect emerges from the pupa, or when the insects are cooled down to a temperature at which they are still. In both cases the insects are still for a period of time which is 10 long enough to be identified by the imaging process and then either picked up or zapped as the imaging process is able to guide a robot arm to find the insect. According to an aspect of some embodiments of the present invention there is provided a method for mechanical sex-sorting of mosquitoes by extracting a class of mosquitoes from unsorted mosquitoes, the method comprising: 15 obtaining said unsorted mosquitoes; obtaining images of individuals of said unsorted mosquitoes in a stationary phase; electronically classifying said individuals from said images into at least one member of a group of classifications including male mosquitoes, female mosquitoes, and unclassified objects; obtaining co-ordinates of individuals of at least one of said male mosquito and female 20 mosquito classifications; using a robot arm to reach an individual identified by ones of said obtained coordinates to store or remove said individuals, thereby to provide sex-sorted mosquitoes. In an embodiment, said classifying comprises using a trained neural network. In an embodiment, said trained neural network comprises four or more layers. 25 In an embodiment, said obtaining images comprises obtaining successive frames, generating differences between said successive frames and using said differences to determine which individuals are in said stationary phase. In an embodiment, said classifying comprises using a recurrent neural network (RNN). In an embodiment, said unsorted insects are emerging pupae and said stationary phase is 30 emergence. In an embodiment, said unsorted insects are adults and said stationary phase is obtained by cooling said insects. ',\n",

       "['SECONDARY SYNCHRONIZATION CODEBOOK FOR E-UTRAN CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] The present Non-provisional Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Patent Application No. 60/955,623 filed on August 13, 2007 and entitled SECONDARY SYNCHRONIZATION CODEBOOK FOR E-UTRAN, assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND I. Field [0002] The following relates generally to wireless communication, and more specifically to determining a secondary synchronization codebook for selecting secondary synchronization codes for a radio network site. II. Background [0003] Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as, e.g., voice content, data content, and so on. Typical wireless communication systems can be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power). Examples of such multiple-access systems can include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like. [0004] Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems can simultaneously support communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations can be established via single-input singleoutput (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth. [0005] MIMO systems commonly employ multiple (Nr) transmit antennas and multiple (NR) receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by theNT transmit and NR receive antennas can be decomposed into Ns independent channels,   which can be referred to as spatial channels, where Ns <{N T ,N R ) . Each of the Ns independent channels corresponds to a dimension. Moreover, MIMO systems can provide improved performance (e.g., increased spectral efficiency, higher throughput and/or greater reliability) if additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and receive antennas are utilized. [0006] Improved performance, throughput and reliability provided by multitransmission wireless access sites can also introduce additional system complexities. For instance, where multiple base stations are transmitting within a common area, and such transmissions are received by a single device, a mechanism to distinguish between such transmissions can be required. Further, a means to distinguish and/or identify one base station from another can be required. One mechanism for identifying a base station(s) and distinguishing received transmissions is by employing channel synchronization. Synchronization can include, in some instances, a primary synchronization code (PSC) that includes frequency and timing information for a transmission, and a secondary synchronization code (SSC) that provides base station identity. In such instances, a device can distinguish and decode one or more transmissions in a multi-transmitter environment by way of the PSC and/or SSC. SUMMARY [0007] The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. [0008] The subject disclosure, in at least some aspects, employs a primary synchronization channel (P-SCH) related scrambling code to scramble secondary synchronization codes (SSCs) of multiple base stations. In addition, various mechanisms are provided to accomplish the scrambling. In at least one additional aspect, PSC-based scrambling codes are created from a plurality of M-sequences generated from a polynomial that is different from a polynomial utilized to generate an SSC. Furthermore, disclosed is an SSC codebook that selects sequence pairs togenerate SSCs for multi-transmitter mobile sites based on power and/or correlation   characteristics of the resulting scrambled SSCs. As a result, interference between multitransmitter SSC transmissions received at a device can be mitigated, providing improved throughput, reliability and consistency for planned, semi-planned and unplanned mobile base station deployments. [0009] According to some aspects, disclosed is a method for generating a secondary synchronization code (SSC) for wireless communication.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0040] Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It can be evident, however, that such aspect(s) can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects. [0041] In addition, various aspects of the disclosure are described below. It should be apparent that the teaching herein can be embodied in a wide variety of forms and that any specific structure and/or function disclosed herein is merely representative. Based on the teachings herein one skilled in the art should appreciate that an aspect disclosed herein can be implemented independently of any other aspects and that two or more of these aspects can be combined in various ways. For example, an apparatus can be implemented and/or a method practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, an apparatus can be implemented and/or a method practiced using other structure and/or functionality in addition to or other than one or more of the aspects set forth herein. As an example, many of the methods, devices, systems and apparatuses described herein are descried in the context of determining characteristics of one or more wireless channels and providing a handover determination based in part on magnitudes of the determined characteristics. One skilled in the art should appreciate that similar techniques could apply to other communication environments. [0042] The subject disclosure provides, in one or more aspects, reduced interference for multiple secondary synchronization code (SSC) transmission in a multitransmitter environment. The environment can be associated with a planned, semiplanned, and/or unplanned mobile communication environment. Typically, radio access network (RAN) base stations (BSs) employ synchronization codes to facilitate over the   air (OTA) communication with mobile devices (e.g., cellular telephones, cellularenabled laptops, multi-mode phones, personal digital assistants [PDAs], and/or the like). Mobile devices monitor the synchronization codes (and other portions of OTA transmissions in some instances) in order to determine when pertinent data is being provided by a BS. Where many BSs exist within a relatively small communication site (e.g., such that a mobile device receives wireless transmission from many BSs), the synchronization codes can interfere with each other, becoming difficult to distinguish at the mobile device. Accordingly, mechanisms to mitigate or avoid synchronization code interference can improve reliability of mobile communications. [0043] According to some aspects, particular mechanisms are provided to generate and scramble an SSC with a P-SCH related scrambling code. Scrambled SSCs can be less likely to interfere with each other when transmitted in a common mobile environment (e.g., a single mobile deployment site, or multiple closely positioned mobile sites). In at least one aspect, SSCs can be generated from a first set of sequences provided by a first mathematical expression, and scrambling codes to scramble the SSCs can be generated from a different mathematical expression. Further, sequence indexes of the scrambling codes can be selected based on a primary synchronization channel (P-SCH). Various mechanisms can be employed to generate the scrambled SSCs and reduce interference of multiple SSCs transmitted by multiple sources (e.g., BSs). [0044] SSCs can be generated from multiple sequences selected from a sequence matrix, comprising a base sequence and variations of the base sequence (e.g., cyclic shifted sequences). The base sequence, selected sequences and/or SSC can be scrambled with a scrambling code(s) to reduce interference of OTA SSCs. As one example, a pair of selected sequences can first be scrambled by the scrambling code(s), the sequences can then be combined to form a full-length scrambled SSC sequence (e.g., by interleaving the sequence pair), which can be mapped to an OTA message. In another example, the pair of sequences can first be interleaved to form an unscrambled full-length sequence and then scrambled by the scrambling code(s), then mapped to the transmission. In other examples, the base sequence can be scrambled such that the sequence matrix comprises the scrambled base sequence and scrambled variations thereof. In such example, a pair of scrambled sequences can be selected from the   matrix, interleaved to form a full-length SSC sequence, and mapped into the OTA message. The scrambled SSC sequences can yield reduced interference of transmittedSSCs and improve transmission reliability for planned, semi-planned or unplanned mobile base station deployment. [0045] According to one or more other aspects, a mechanism to generate PSCbased scrambling codes is provided that can randomize interference between encoded signals. Multiple sequences (e.g., three sequences) are employed to generate a scrambling code for one or more SSCs. The multiple sequences can comprise a set of full-length sequences (or, e.g., modified full-length sequences, such as one-bit truncated), or a set of half-length sequences appended to other half-length sequences of such a set. In at least one aspect, the set of full-length and/or half-length sequences are generated from a common M-sequence polynomial. In another aspect, the set of fulllength and/or half-length sequences can be generated from a plurality of M-sequence polynomials. In at least one additional aspect, PSC-based scrambling codes are created from three half-length M-sequences generated from a polynomial that is different from a polynomial utilized to generate an SSC. [0046] In accordance with one or more other aspects, provided is an SSC codebook for generating SSCs for a multi-transmitter mobile site. The SSCs can be generated from various sequences of a sequence matrix. The sequences can be selected based on PAPR and/or correlation determinations of SSCs that result from a pair of sequences. Thus, the resulting SSCs can exhibit improved transmission and reduced interference because of such aspects of the subject disclosure.

As used in this application, the term \"or\" is intended to mean an inclusive \"or\" rather than an exclusive \"or\". That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from context, \"X employs A or B\" is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, if X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B, then \"X employs A or B\" is satisfied under any of the foregoing instances.

Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. [0054] Referring now to the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates a wireless   communication system 100 with multiple base stations 110 and multiple terminals 120, such as can be utilized in conjunction with one or more aspects. A base station ( 110) is generally a fixed station that communicates with the terminals and can also be called an access point, a Node B, or some other terminology. Each base station 110 provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area or coverage area, illustrated as three geographic areas in Fig. 1, labeled 102a, 102b, and 102c. The term \"cell\" canrefer to a base station and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. To improve system capacity, a base station geographic area/coverage area can be partitioned into multiple smaller areas (e.g. , three smaller areas, according to cell 102a in Fig. 1), 104a, 104b, and 104c. Each smaller area (104a, 104b, 104c) can be served by a respective base transceiver subsystem (BTS). The term \"sector\" can refer to a BTS and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the term is used. For a sectorized cell, the BTSs for all sectors of that cell are typically co-located within the base station for the cell. The transmission techniques described herein can be used for a system with sectorized cells as well as a system with un-sectorized cells. For simplicity, in the following description, unless specified otherwise, the term \"base station\" is used generically for a fixed station that serves a sector as well as a fixed station that serves a cell. [0055] Terminals 120 are typically dispersed throughout the system, and each terminal can be fixed or mobile. A terminal can also be called a mobile station, user equipment, a user device, or some other terminology. A terminal can be a wireless device, a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem card, and so on. Each terminal 120 can communicate with zero, one, or multiple base stations on the downlink and uplink at any given moment. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. [0056] For a centralized architecture, a system controller 130 couples to base stations 110 and provides coordination and control for base stations 110. For a distributed architecture, base stations 110 can communicate with one another as needed. Data transmission on the forward link often occurs from one access point to one access terminal at or near the maximum data rate that can be supported by the forward link and/or the communication system. Additional channels of the forward link (e.g., control   channel) can be transmitted from multiple access points to one access terminal. Reverse link data communication can occur from one access terminal to one or more access points. [0057] Fig. 2 is an illustration of an ad hoc or unplanned/semi-planned wireless communication environment 200, in accordance with various aspects. System 200 can comprise one or more base stations 202 in one or more cells and/or sectors that receive, transmit, repeat, etc., wireless communication signals to each other and/or to one ormore mobile devices 204. As illustrated, each base station 202 can provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area, illustrated as four geographic areas, labeled 206a, 206b, 206c and 206d. Each base station 202 can comprise a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, and so forth.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. Mobile devices 204 can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless network 200. System 200 can be employed in conjunction with various aspects described herein in order to facilitate providing and/or utilizing synchronized OTA message transmission in a wireless communication environment (200), as set forth herein with regard to subsequent figures. [0058] Fig. 3 is a block diagram of an example system 300 that provides reduced interference for synchronization messages in a mobile communication environment. A synchronization message as utilized in the context of system 300 can include an SSC. It should also be appreciated that aspects of a primary synchronization code (PSC), or of a P-SCH, can be employed to reduce interference of an SSC, as discussed herein. It should be further appreciated that a mobile communication environment pertinent to system 300 can include a third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), referred hereinafter collectively as LTE, system, an evolved universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) terrestrial radio access network (E-UTRAN) system, or a combination thereof or of the like. For instance, other suitable mobile communication architectures employing orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) access technology, frequency division multiplexing   (FDM), including e.g., orthogonal FDM (OFDM), coded OFDM (COFDM), and/or the like, are included in such a mobile communication environment. It should further be appreciated that one of skill in the art may determine appropriate mechanisms to apply the below techniques to other mobile communication environments, including code division multiple access (CDMA) environments (e.g., CDMA2000, 3GPP2, etc.), time division multiple access (TDMA) environments (e.g., TDMA), time division duplex (TDD) environments, or suitable combinations thereof (e.g. , TD-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, UMTS-TDD, FDMA/TDMA/FDD, etc.).[0059] System 300 can comprise an SSC generator 302 coupled to one or more base stations of a RAN 306 (e.g., an E-UTRAN). One or more devices 304 can be serviced by the RAN 306. The base stations (306) can communicate with the mobile device 304 by exchanging OTA messages there with. An OTA message sent to the mobile device(s) 304 typically include one or more synchronization messages to facilitate such communication. For instance, a PSC can be utilized to indicate where data is packed in the message, message length, synchronization frequency, or the like. An SSC can provide the prior information, as well as an identity of a transmitting base station 306. Thus, the SSC can be utilized by the mobile device 304 to distinguish one base station (306) from another (306) in a multi-transmitter site 306. [0060] Where multiple OTA messages are transmitted by multiple base stations, at substantially concurrent times, interference between the messages can result. Interference with respect to synchronization information can lead to missed messages, increased power consumption at mobile device 304, and communication inefficiency. To mitigate occurrence of interference, SSC generator 302 can employ one or more scrambling codes to reduce likelihood that two SSCs will interfere with each other at a receiving device (304). [0061] System 300 can further comprise a logic processor 308 that generates a sequence matrix utilized to create one or more SSCs for base stations of the RAN 306. For instance, a sequence, sequence pair, sequence triplet, etc. , can be utilized to generate an SSC. In one aspect, pairs of length-31 sequences (e.g., binary sequences having 3 1 binary bits) are employed to generate 62 bit SSCs. The sequence pairs can be selected from the sequence matrix generated by logic processor 308. In one example, the sequence matrix can be generated from a single base M-sequence of length-3 1. Such a   sequence can be derived from a suitable polynomial expression. In other aspects, logic processor 308 derives the base M-sequence from a different polynomial expression than that used by a data transformation module 310 (below) to generate sequences for SSC scrambling codes. As a particular example, the polynomial expression utilized to generate the base M-sequence can be of the form xL5 + xL2 + 1 over GF(2), where GF(2) indicates a Galois Field that limits results of the expression to binary digits. [0062] Once a base sequence is generated by the logic processor 308, variations of the base sequence can be formed to populate the sequence matrix. In some aspects, a number of variations are generated that is substantially equivalent to a number of digitsof the base sequence. {E.g., if the base sequence comprises 3 1 digits, 29, 30, 31, or substantially similar number of variations are generated). The variations are combined with the base sequence to form the sequence matrix {e.g., where the first, second, third, etc., rows of the matrix comprise the base sequence, first variation, second variation, etc., respectively, and where the first, second, third, etc., columns of the matrix comprise the first, second, third, etc., digits of each sequence, respectively - e.g., see Fig. 4, supra). [0063] Once the sequence matrix is defined, logic processor can select multiple sequences from the matrix that can be utilized to generate an SSC. As one example, a pair of length-31 sequences can be selected to form a length-62 SSC. Each such SSC can then be assigned to one or more base stations of the RAN 306, and can carry identifying information {e.g., base station ID) distinguishing such base stations from other base stations. As discussed in more detail at Figs. 5 and 6, infra, the selection can be based on multiple factors, including, but not limited to, PAPR of a resulting SSC, or signal correlation, or a combination thereof or of the like. To reduce interference between SSCs transmitted by RAN 306, the SSCs can be scrambled by employing one or more scrambling sequences, such as a PSC-bases sequence, discussed below. [0064] System 300 can further comprise a data transformation module 310 that scrambles at least one sequence of a sequence matrix with a common binary scrambling code. In at least one aspect, the scrambling code can be generated by a sequence module 312 that employs sequences derived from a common polynomial expression. The common polynomial expression and/or derived sequences can be based on a PSC associated with wireless communication {e.g., OTA message). As an example, indices   derived from the PSC can be employed to select sequence pairs, sequence triplets, or the like {e.g., from a scrambling code sequence matrix), to generate the scrambling code. Selection of scrambling code sequences based on the PSC can provide reduced interference for OTA transmission of multiple SSCs. [0065] It should be appreciated that the data transformation module 310 can employ the scrambling sequence to scramble a multiplexed SSC, components of an SSC {e.g., sequences of a sequence pair, triplet, etc., that form the SSC), or sequences of the sequence matrix itself. In one particular example, data transformation module 310 can scramble a base sequence utilized to generate a sequence matrix. Derivative sequences of the scrambled base sequence {e.g., cyclic shifted variations) utilized to form thesequence matrix are inherently scrambled as well. Accordingly, a sequence matrix can be formed of scrambled sequences (e.g. , by employing the scrambled base sequence or variations thereof), unscrambled sequences (e.g., by employing the unscrambled base sequence and variations thereof), or both. A matrix of scrambled sequences can be selected by logic processor 308, interleaved by multiplexing module 314, and mapped to an OTA message by transmission processor 316, as discussed in more detail below. [0066] In other examples, a scrambling code can be applied to one or more nonscrambled sequences selected from an unscrambled sequence matrix. For instance, data transformation module 310 can scramble multiple short sequences selected from such a matrix that are then interleaved by a multiplexing module 314 to form a full-length SSC sequence. As another example, multiplexing module 314 can interleave the short sequences first, and then provide the resulting full-length sequence to the data transformation module 312, which scrambles the full-length sequence. The scrambled sequence is then utilized as an SSC for one or more base stations (306). [0067] Various types of scrambling codes, as known in the art or made known to one of skill in the art by way of the context provided herein, can be generated by sequence module 312. As mentioned above, sequence module 312 can generate various sequences (e.g., M-sequences) from a common polynomial expression, or different polynomial expressions. In at least one aspect, three length-63 M-sequence based scrambling codes are generated, where each length-63 sequence is truncated by one bit to form a scrambling code (or, e.g., one bit is changed to 0 and mapped to a DC tone of a wireless transmission). In another example, three length-31 M-sequence based   scrambling codes are generated, and repetition is employed to generate three length-62 scrambling codes (e.g., where B is a length-31 sequence, repetition can be of the form [B, B]). [0068] In at least one particular aspect, each of multiple scrambling code sequences can be formed from a single polynomial expression. In one aspect, the polynomial expression can be of the form l+x L2+xL3+xL4+xL5. A resulting scrambling code sequence can be represented by C(0,n). As a specific example of a suitable scrambling sequence, C(0,n) can denote the following M-sequence: C(0,n) = (-1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1, -1,-1,1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,IjThe above sequence C(0,n) can represent a base M-sequence. Cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence (e.g., see Fig. 4, infra) can be defined as C(k,n) = C(0,(n+k) mod N). Accordingly, length-63 scrambling codes can be obtained as: [C(u,0),C(u,0),...,C(u,14),C(u,14),C(u,15),0,C(u,15),C (u,16),C(u,16),...,C(u,30),C(u,30 )] where 0 can be mapped to a DC tone of a frequency-based transmission. It should be appreciated that other length codes can be generated by setting suitable values for k and n for C(k,n) (e.g., k and n can have suitable values greater than 0). For the length-63 case, distinct scrambling codes can be generated by selecting distinct values of V . Values of V can be selected based on a desired number of scrambling code sequences for a set of such sequences. For instance, five, ten, twenty, etc., variations of the base M-sequence can be selected. For 31 possible sequences, \\'u\\' can correspond to the set {0, . .., 30}. [0069] In at least one aspect, sequence module 312 can generate three scrambling sequences from the formula C(k,n) = C(O,(n+k) mod N). The scrambling codes can correspond to the following three values of V : {0, 10, 20}, thus utilizing the base M-sequence, a tenth cyclic shifted variation of the base sequence, and a twentieth cyclic shifted variation of the base sequence. The resulting three scrambling code sequences are: C(0,n) = {-1,1, 1,1,-1,-1,-1, 1,-1, 1,-1, 1,1,-1, 1,-1,-1,-1,-1, 1,1,-1,-1, 1,-1,-1, 1,1, 1,1,1} C(10,n) = {-1,1,1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1, -1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1} C(20,n) = { 1,-1,-1,1,-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1, -1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1} [0070] The foregoing scrambling sequences can be employed to generate   scrambling codes of varying length (e.g., length-62 scrambling code) and combined with SSC sequences. Scrambled sequences are mapped into wireless transmissions, as discussed below. By employing scrambling sequences of a common polynomial expression, a significant reduction in interference among transmitted SSCs can be accomplished [0071] System 300 can further comprise a transmission processor 316. The transmission processor 316 can map an SSC onto components of an OTA message.Specifically, the SSC can be mapped onto sub-carrier channels of a frequency based message (e.g., FDM, OFDM, OFDMA), onto code divisions of a code based message (e.g., CDMA, CDMA-2000, wideband CDMA [WCDMA]), onto time divisions of a time based message (e.g., TDMA), or suitable sub-components of combined system messages (e.g., TD-CDMA, TD-SCDMA, UMTS-TDD, FDMA/TDMA/FDD, etc.). The OTA message can be received at mobile device 304, which can employ suitable techniques for decoding the message and the SSC. In at least one instance, the mobile device 304 can employ a substantially inverse process for decoding the SSC as SSC generator 302 employs for coding/scrambling the SSC. Instructions for decoding the SSC can be pre-loaded onto the mobile device 302, downloaded from a network patch or the like (e.g., a software and/or firmware patch at a service provider\\'s network server), or included within the OTA message (e.g., in a message preamble, or the like). [0072] As described, system 300 can provide substantial benefit for wireless communications. SSC scrambling codes generated from a common polynomial expression and indexed based on a corresponding PSC can result in reduced interference for SSCs transmitted by multiple base stations (306). Such a result can be of even greater benefit where large numbers of base stations (306) exist in a semi-planned or un planned deployment, where interference can be high and signal to noise ratios (SNR) relatively low. Accordingly, system 300 can provide for increased efficiency and OTA reliability even for unfavorable wireless environments. [0073] Fig. 4 illustrates an example sequence matrix 400 that can be utilized to generate synchronization codes and/or scrambling codes for various aspects described herein. Sequence matrix 400 comprises a number of sequences represented by rows of the matrix 400. The first (top) row of the matrix is a base sequence. Lower rows of the matrix are variations of the base sequence. As depicted in Fig. 4, the lower rows are   cyclic shifted variations of the base sequence, although it should be appreciated that other suitable variations of a binary base sequence, known in the art, can be utilized to generate a similar sequence matrix to that depicted at 400. As depicted by the arrows in shown amongst the sequence matrix 400, the cyclic shift is a single digit shift whereby variations of the base sequence are formed by shifting each sequence bit one position, or one matrix column, as compared to a previous sequence. Thus, bit 1 for the base sequence is -1, and a first cyclic shifted variation of the base sequence, depicted at row 2 of the matrix, has the same - 1 in the second bit (second column). Further, each bit ofthe base sequence is shifted into the next right-most column in the first cyclic shifted sequence. It should be appreciated that multiple cyclic shifts can be employed instead, such that each bit is shifted two columns, three columns, etc., with respect to previous sequences instead of a single column. [0074] Additional rows of the matrix exhibit further shifts of the base sequence. Thus, bits of the second cyclic shifted sequence (row 3) are shifted two columns from the base sequence (row 1), and so on, throughout each row. For a matrix having \\'L\\' columns, based on sequence lengths of \\'L\\', the matrix can comprise at least \\'L\\' unique sequences, including the base sequence and L-I single cyclic shifted variations of the base sequence. Such a sequence can be employed to generate synchronization codes and/or scrambling codes as described herein. Where \\'L\\' matches a desired code length, single sequences of the matrix 400 can be employed to create such codes. Alternatively, where \\'L\\' is shorter than the desired code length, multiple sequences of the matrix 400 can be employed to create the code(s). [0075] As an example to illustrate the foregoing, a desired code length {e.g., SSC length) is 62 bits. Where \\'L\\' is equal to 62, a single sequence of the matrix 400 can be utilized to form a code. Where \\'L\\' is equal to 31, sequence pairs of the matrix 400 can be interleaved to from the code. Where \\'L\\' is equal to 2 1, a sequence triplet, with one of the sequences truncated by one bit, can be interleaved to generate the code. It should also be appreciated that substantially similar sequence lengths can be employed in conjunction with bit truncation and/or bit repetition {e.g., a length-63 Msequence can be truncated by one bit to form the length-62 code, also length-30 or length-32 sequence pairs can be employed in conjunction with single bit repetition or truncation, respectively, to form the length-62 code, etc.).   [0076] For dense base station deployment, where dozens or hundreds of base stations operate at a common geographic site {e.g., see Fig. 1, supra), employing pairs, triplets, etc., of sequences of shorter length than a target code length can be beneficial. This is due to the fact that many more unique sequence pairs, triplets, etc., can be extracted from the sequence matrix 400 than single sequences. For instance, if \\'L\\' is equal to 62, and a desired SSC length is 62 bits, 62 unique single sequences exist to form 62 distinct SSCs. However, where matrix 400 has \\'L\\' = 31, and for a length-62 SSC, there are 961 (31L2) sequence pairs that can form 961 different SSCs. As another example, for \\'L=20\\' or \\'L=21 \\' (employing bit repetition or truncation) there are 8,000or 9261, respectively, sequence triplet combinations that can generate different SSCs. Accordingly, by selecting an appropriate sequence length with respect to a desired SSC length, and employing pairs, triplets, etc., of sequences, a number of unique codes generated by a matrix (400) can be increased. [0077] In at least one specific example of the claimed subject matter, matrix 400 is a square matrix having 3 1 M-sequences of length \\'L\\' equal to 31. The base sequence is a binary sequence generated from a polynomial expression of the form xL5 + xL2 + 1 over GF(2). Further, the additional sequences are single cyclic shifted variations of the base sequence {e.g., as depicted by the arrows of the sequence matrix 400). Pairs of sequences can be selected and interleaved to form various distinct SSC codes. As described elsewhere herein, SSC scrambling can be implemented in various ways {e.g., see Fig. 3, supra). In one example, the selected pairs can be interleaved to form length- 62 sequences and then scrambled. Alternatively, the selected length-3 1 sequences can be scrambled and then interleaved to form the length-62 sequence. As yet another alternative, the base M-sequence can be scrambled, such that each cyclic shifted variation of the matrix 400 is also scrambled. Scrambled sequence pairs can then be selected and interleaved to form the length-62 SSC code. Optionally, a 0 bit can be added to the length-62 codes to form length-63 codes, where the 0 bit is mapped to a DC tone of a wireless transmission. Thus, a variety of mechanisms can be employed to reduce interference of overlapping wireless messages received at a device, providing improved reception and overall communication, as well as potentially reducing power at the receiving device {e.g., by avoiding repeat transmission). [0078] Fig. 5 depicts a block diagram of an example system 500 that provides   reduced interference for transmitted SSCs in a multi-transmitter mobile site. More specifically, system 500 provides a selective codebook for choosing sequence combinations for generating resulting SSCs. In some aspects, the sequence combinations can be based on underlying characteristics of a resulting SSC. Accordingly, improved wireless transmission can be accomplished by properly selecting SSCs that yield desirable traits in a mobile communication environment. [0079] System 500 includes an SSC index selector 502 that identifies a sequence or group of sequences {e.g., sequence pair) for generating one or more SSCs that can be assigned to a base station 504 of a RAN (not depicted, but see Fig. 3, at 306). The SSC index selector 502 can comprise a logic processor 506 that forms a sequence matrixfrom which the sequence or group of sequences can be selected. The sequence matrix can be formed utilizing a base sequence and a number of variations of the base sequence. In at least one aspect, the base sequence is a binary M-sequence of length n+1, and the matrix comprises the base sequence and n cyclic shifted variations of the base sequence (e.g., as depicted at Fig. 4, supra). An indexing module 508 can assign indices to sequences and/or groups of sequences of the sequence matrix. Sequences /groups of sequences can be selected by reference to an assigned index. In at least one aspect of the subject disclosure, the index module assigns substantially (n+1) indices, where x is a number of sequences in a group. Thus, for single sequences, substantially n+1 indices are assigned. For sequence pairs, substantially (n+l) L2 indices are assigned, and so on. [0080] Where more distinct SSC sequence combinations exist than base stations (504) requiring an SSC, a pruning module 510 can select sequences/sequence groups based on characteristics of a resulting SSC. The characteristics can be based on results of a signal emulator, for instance, that can determine interference, power loss, crosscorrelation, and like characteristics of an SSC. Sequences/sequence groups yielding SSCs with desirable characteristics, such as low PAPR, can be selected to generate SSCs. [0081] As a particular example to illustrate aspects of system 500, logic processor 506 defines a sequence matrix having 3 1 length-31 sequences. Sequence pairs of the matrix can be represented by (u, v), where u and v both have values {0, . .., 30} . A number of length-62 SSCs can be generated based on the sequence pairs (u,v) of   the sequence matrix. Indexing module 508 assigns (n+l) L2, or 961, indices to the 961 distinct sequence pairs of the sequence matrix. An algorithm of the form r = u*3 1+v can be used to generate these indices. In one aspect of the example, pruning module 510 selects 170 of the 961 distinct indices based on characteristics of SSC signals comprised of the sequence pairs (e.g., including scrambling, such as provided by a common PSC-based scrambling code, and interleaving the sequences). One or more of the selected SSCs (e.g., a pair), can then be modulated by a transmission processor 512 (e.g., employing a modulator, signal coder, etc.) into a radio frame to resolve a frame boundary of the radio frame. As one particular aspect of the example, the following SSC indices r = u*31+v corresponding to a maximum PAPR of substantially 6.75 decibels (dB) can be employed:16 18 2 0 33 62 63 66 70 7 1 75 80 83 9 3 99 104 105 113 116 121 125 126 140 153 168 169 170 173 189 190 191 203 204 210 211 220 226 228 233 236 241 251 261 267 268 270 278 287 293 300 304 313 317 327 332 336 338 339 344 346 355 367 377 379 388 395 399 401 417 418 419 422 424 426 435 439 445 452 453 456 457 466 475 478 482 486 488 493 498 508 515 516 517 518 531 533 534 543 546 553 554 560 565 587 589 592 606 614 618 621 623 625 628 631 636 645 653 665 677 678 684 700 707 708 711 713 714 719 725 728 735 738 745 751 752 755 765 770 777 781 789 797 801 802 810 816 818 819 826 829 831 851 854 856 862 863 871 879 889 897 901 909 910 913 916 917 930 938 940 946 954 [0082] In another aspect o f the example, pruning module 510 selects 340 o f the 961 distinct indices, also based on characteristics o f SSC signals comprised o f the selected sequence pairs. Different tones derived from one or more o f 340 resulting SSCs (e.g., different tones o f a pair o f SSCs) can b e modulated by transmission processor 512 into the radio frame to resolve the frame boundary o f the radio frame. In one specific aspect, the following SSC indices r = u*31+v can b e employed that   correspond to a maximum PAPR o f substantially 7.18dB: 2 5 6 7 1 1 14 17 18 2 0 2 3 2 7 30 33 37 39 4 1 4 3 44 4 7 50 53 60 6 1 63 65 66 6 8 70 7 1 74 75 80 84 86 8 99 101 102 104 105 107 111 113 114 115 116 121 125 126 137 140 144 151 153 155 158 168 169 170 173 183 187 189 190 191 197 203 204 205 209 210 211 212 217 219 220 225 226 227 228 233 236 238 240 241 257 259 261 263 266 267 268 270 271 276 277 278 285 286 290 292 293 294 300 303 304 306 307 310 311 312 313 316 317 327 331 332 336 338 339 341 342 344 346 347 353 359 360 362 363 365 372 373 374 377 379 382 383 388 394 399 401 406 413 417 418 419 420 421 422 424 426 430 439 442 445 446 450 452 453 454 456 457 463 466 475 478 482 483 485 486 492 493 494 495 498 499 505 506 508 513 515 516 517 518 519 527 528 531 533 534 539 543 549 550 553 554 560 565 569 570 571 572 573 579 583 587 588 589 590 592 594 596 603 606 607 609 610 614 620 621 625 630 631 634 636 637 642 645 646 653 657 659 661 664 668 675 677 678 679 681 682 684 686 690 694 699 700 702 707 708 709 720 725 726 728 732 733 735 738 739 740 741 747 751 752 753 755 760 764 767 770 772 773 780 781 782 785 787 789 791 795 797 801 802 805 810 811 815 818 819 821 823 825 826 830 831 838 842 845 846 851 853 854 856 862 863 868 871 875 876 878 879 881 889 891 892 897 901 906 907 909 910 913 916 917 918 919 925 930 935 936 940 942 943 944 951 954 957 959[0083] In yet another example for selecting code indices, 170, 340, or another suitable number of indices can be selected based on minimizing a number of   overlapping code indices used in a single SSC. For example, a first set of length-31 sequences V can employ indices {0, 1, 2, . .., 19}. A second set of length-3 1 sequences V can employ indices { 1 1, 13, 14, . .., 30} such that overlap between V and V sequences of resulting SSCs are minimized. Reduced index overlap can, in some instances, provide reduced interference between transmitted codes. [0084] As described, system 500 can provide an SSC codebook that selects SSCs based on underlying characteristics of the transmitted synchronization signal. Such a result can lead to improved signal reception for terminal devices in a mobile environment, a decrease in repetitive traffic (e.g., fewer data retransmission requests), and lower power consumption for such terminals. Accordingly, substantial benefits can be provided by system 500 for a mobile communication environment. [0085] Fig. 6 illustrates a block diagram of an example system 600 that employs an SSC codebook as described herein for reducing interference between SSC transmissions. Selection of SSC codes can be based on comparison of transmission power and/or cross-correlation characteristics of a simulated SSC and one or more thresholds. Resulting SSC(s) can be modulated into a wireless transmission (e.g., a radio frame) to resolve a frame boundary of the transmission. Because SSC selection is based on underlying SSC characteristics, improved power and/or correlation characteristics can be provided by system 600 for mobile communications. [0086] System 600 comprises an SSC index selector 602 that indexes sequences or groups of sequences of a sequence matrix. The index selector can select one or more indices based on power and/or cross-correlation characteristics of a simulated SSC code 604 that results from a particular sequence(s) identified by an index. Determined power and/or cross-correlation characteristics can be qualified based on comparison to one or more thresholds. For instance, pruning module 606 can condition selection of a particular index based on comparison of SSC PAPR to a PAPR threshold (e.g., based on a nominal OFDM symbol), comparison of SSC cross-correlation to a cross-correlation threshold, or both. Thus, resulting SSCs can be generated that have predetermined quality characteristics. [0087] System 600 can employ a signal simulation module 608 to determine PAPR of simulated SSCs (604) resulting from a sequence(s) identified by a particularindex. Signal simulation module 608 can compare the determined PAPR to a threshold   PAPR, and forward the results to pruning module 606. A relatively low PAPR is typically beneficial (e.g., as compared with transmission of typical frequency-modulated signals) for wireless transmission, resulting in negligible impact on downlink transmissions in many instances. Thus, the threshold can typically specify some maximum acceptable PAPR, an acceptable range within a desired PAPR (e.g. , within 3dB of the desired PAPR), a number of SSCs below the desired PAPR (e.g., 30 SSCs having PAPR values below the desired PAPR), or the like, or a suitable combination thereof. [0088] System 600 can also employ a signal correlation module 610 that determines a cross-correlation factor of simulated SSCs (604) resulting from a sequence(s) identified by a particular index. Signal correlation module 610 can compare a determined cross-correlation to a cross-correlation threshold to qualify the simulated SSC 604. Signals strongly correlated with other signals can often exhibit high interference, thus minimal cross-correlation can be desired. Accordingly, pruning module 606 can condition selection of a particular sequence index based at least in part on cross-correlation being equal or lower than the threshold correlation. In some aspects, pruning module 606 can condition selection of a particular sequence index on a combination of PAPR results and cross-correlation results. For instance, if a simulated SSC (604) has a PAPR lower than a threshold PAPR and correlation lower than a correlation threshold, an index associated with the simulated SSC (604) can be selected. As described, system 600 provides a convenient mechanism for selecting indices of a sequence matrix in order to provide beneficial PAPR and/or low cross-correlation characteristics, resulting in improved wireless transmission and reliability in many instances. [0089] Fig. 7 depicts a block diagram of an example system 700 comprising a base station 702 and one or more mobile devices 704 according to aspects of the subject disclosure. In at least one aspect of the subject disclosure, base station 702 can determine suitable SSC codes and/or scrambling codes to reduce interference of transmitted synchronization information. Specifically, various mechanisms for generating and scrambling SSCs, generating scrambling codes (e.g., based on three length-31 M-sequences) for such SSCs, and selecting sequence indices based on   characteristics of such SSCs can be accomplished by base station 702. Accordingly,system 700 facilitates improved mobile communication by providing improved transmission characteristics for OTA messages received at one or more mobile devices 704 in a mobile communication environment. [0090] System 700 comprises a base station 702 (e.g., access point, . ..) with a receiver 710 that receives signal(s) from one or more mobile devices 704 through a plurality of receive antennas 706, and a transmitter 728 that transmits to the one or more mobile devices 704 through a transmit antenna(s) 708. Receiver 710 can receive information from receive antennas 706 and can further comprise a signal recipient (not shown) that receives uplink data synchronized in accordance with a PSC and/or SSC provided by base station 702. Additionally, receiver 710 is operatively associated with a demodulator 712 that demodulates received information. Demodulated symbols are analyzed by a processor 714 that is coupled to a memory 716 that stores information related to generating a sequence matrix to provide synchronization and/or scrambling codes, as well as selecting, scrambling and/or multiplexing such sequences to form the SSCs, selecting sequences according to an SSC codebook as described herein, known in the art or made known to one of skill in the art by way of the context provided herein, and/or any other suitable information related to performing the various actions and functions set forth herein. [0091] Processor 714 is further coupled to a logic processor 718 that can generate a sequence matrix from at least a base M-sequence and cyclic shifted variations of such sequence (e.g., n cyclic shifted variations). The processor 714 can be further coupled to a data transformation module 720 that can scramble various sequences of the sequence matrix provided by the logic processor 718. For instance, the data transformation module 720 can employ a common binary scrambling code based on a PSC associated with a wireless communication to scramble at least one such sequence pertinent to an SSC, as described herein. [0092] Additionally, the processor 714 can be coupled to a multiplexing module 722 that can generate an SSC based on at least one scrambled sequence provided by the data transformation module 720. For instance, where the data transformation module 720 scrambles a base sequence of a sequence matrix, any suitable cyclic shifted variation of the scrambled base sequence, and/or the scrambled base sequence itself, can   be utilized by the multiplexing module 722 to form the SSC. The SSC can be formedby interleaving two or more sequences, repetition of one or more sequences, addition/truncation of bits, or the like, as required. [0093] Processor 714 can further be associated with a sequence module 724. Sequence module 724 can generate the scrambling code from one or more sequences provided by the logic processor 718 (e.g., based on a common polynomial expression that is different from an expression used to generate SSC-related sequences). In one example, the sequence module 724 can generate three suitable M-sequences, either length-63 or length-31, to form the scrambling code(s). The three M-sequences can be generated from a base M-sequence and cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence, for example. Further, in at least some aspects, at least 20 cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence can be created, and the three M-sequences can comprise the base Msequence, a tenth cyclic shifted variation, and a twentieth cyclic-shifted variation. It should be appreciated, however, that other variations of the base sequence can be employed, and other selected members of the set of variations can be utilized for the three (or, e.g., other suitable number) of scrambling code sequences. [0094] Base station 702 can further comprise a modulator 726 that can map an SSC to an OTA message transmitted by transmitter 728. In one aspect, the SSC can be mapped onto some or all sub-carrier channels of an OFDM transmission. The OTA message can be sent via the transmission antennas 708 to mobile device 704. It should be appreciated that base station 702 can be part of a planned, semi-planned or unplanned deployment of several base stations (not depicted) operating in a common area. Generation, scrambling and assignment of SSCs can be implemented by base station 702 in a predetermined manner specified by logic processor 718, and sequence module 724, or other instructions stored in memory 716 and executed by processor 714 pertinent to multi-base station operation. In the alternative, base station 702 can communicate with other nearby base stations over a backhaul network (not depicted) to coordinate assignment of SSCs to various base stations of a cell site. In at least one other alternative, code assignments can be specified at least in part by a centralized entity (not depicted, but see Fig. 3, supra) and provided to base station 702. Accordingly, system 700 can function as part of a RAN comprising multiple base stations.   [0095] Fig. 8 illustrates a block diagram of an example system 800 that comprises a mobile device 802. Mobile device 802 can be configured to receive anddecode synchronization information within an OTA message transmitted by a base station 804. Decoding processes at the mobile device 802 can be inverse to similar processes employed by the base station 804. Instructions for receiving and decoding the message can be pre-loaded at the mobile device 802, included at least in part within the OTA message, obtained by way of a software/firmware patch (e.g., over a network, or connection to a computing device), or a combination thereof or of the like. [0096] Mobile handset 802 includes at least one antenna 806 (e.g., a transmission receiver or group of such receivers comprising an input interface) that receives a signal (e.g. , comprising synchronization information pertinent to facilitating remote wireless communication) and a receiver 808, which performs typical actions (e.g., filters, amplifies, down-converts, etc.) on the received signal. Specifically, antenna 806 and transmitter 830 (collectively referred to as a transceiver) can be configured to facilitate wireless data exchange with base station 804. [0097] Antenna 806 and receiver 808 can also be coupled with a demodulator 810 that can demodulate received symbols and provide them to a processor 812 for evaluation. Specifically, demodulator 810 can extract at least synchronization information from received wireless transmissions. For frequency-based transmission, for instance, the demodulator 810 can extract the synchronization information from subcarrier frequencies of the wireless transmissions. In one aspect, the synchronization information can comprise at least an SSC further comprised of at least two sequences scrambled with a common PSC-based binary scrambling code. A signal processor 814 can employ a common PSC-based binary descrambling code to decipher the at least two sequences comprising the received SSC. The descrambling code can be substantially equivalent to the scrambling code employed by the base station 804, or can be a counterpart thereof (e.g., an inverted scrambling code). In at least one aspect, decoding the synchronization information involves a data processor 820 that applies a first reverse cyclic shift to a first of the two sequences associated with the SSC and a second reverse cyclic shift to a second of the two sequences. In such aspect(s), the signal processor 814 can then apply the descrambling code to the shifted first sequence and shifted second sequence to decipher the SSC.   [0098] Once the received SSC is decoded, a logic processor 818 can extract identification information pertinent to a device (804) that transmitted the received data.Such information can be utilized to further decode received data (e.g. , payload information) and/or facilitate communication with the transmitting device (804). [0099] It should be appreciated that processor 812 can control and/or reference one or more components (806, 808, 810, 816, 822) of the mobile handset 802. Further, processor 812 can execute one or more modules, applications, engines, or the like (814, 818, 820) that comprise information or controls pertinent to executing functions of the mobile device 802. For instance, such functions can include receiving data from a remote source (804), decoding the received data based on a particular descrambling code, identifying a mobile network transmitter (804) associated with the deciphered code, or the like, as described above. [00100] Mobile handset 802 can additionally include memory 816 that is operatively coupled to processor 812. Memory 816 can store data to be transmitted, received, and the like. Further, memory 816 can store the modules, applications, engines, etc. (814, 818, 820) executed by processor 812, above. [00101] Mobile handset 802 can still further comprise a modulator 822, and a transmitter 824 that transmits generated signals (e.g., by processor 812 and modulator 822) to, for instance, base station 804, an access point, another access terminal, a remote agent, etc. As described, system 800 provides a mobile device 802 that can facilitate receiving coded synchronization information provided by a base station 804 and decipher the coded information to facilitate wireless communication between such devices (802, 804). Because the synchronization information can be encoded based on a selected SSC codebook and/or based on certain scrambling codes, reduced interference and improved reliability and reduced power consumption at the mobile device 802 can potentially be accomplished. [00102] The aforementioned systems have been described with respect to interaction between several components, modules and/or communication interfaces. It should be appreciated that such systems and components/modules/interfaces can include those components or sub-components specified therein, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components. For example, a system could include SSC generator 108, pruning module 510 and transmission processor 512,   or a different combination of these and other components. Sub-components could also be implemented as components communicatively coupled to other components rather than included within parent components. Additionally, it should be noted that one ormore components could be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality. For instance, signal simulation module 608 can include signal correlation module 610, or vice versa, to facilitate determining peak to average power and cross correlation of an SSC by way of a single component. The components may also interact with one or more other components not specifically described herein but known by those of skill in the art. [00103] Furthermore, as will be appreciated, various portions of the disclosed systems above and methods below may include or consist of artificial intelligence or knowledge or rule based components, sub-components, processes, means, methodologies, or mechanisms (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, classifiers. ..). Such components, inter alia, and in addition to that already described herein, can automate certain mechanisms or processes performed thereby to make portions of the systems and methods more adaptive as well as efficient and intelligent. [00104] In view of the exemplary systems described supra, methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter will be better appreciated with reference to the flow charts of FIGs. 9-1 1. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter. Additionally, it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers. The term article of manufacture, as used, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, device in conjunction with a carrier, or storage medium. [00105] Fig. 9 depicts a flowchart of an example methodology 900 for reducing   interference of multiple SSC transmissions according to aspects of the subject disclosure. Method 900, at 902, can generate a sequence matrix. The sequence matrix can comprise M-sequences generated from one or more polynomial expressions. In at least one aspect of the subject disclosure, the M-sequences are generated from apolynomial expression of the form xL5 + xL2 + 1 over GF(2). Additionally, the Msequences can comprise a base sequence and various variations of the base sequence, such as provided by cyclic shifting the base sequence. [00106] At 904, method 900 can scramble at least one M-sequence with a PSCbased scrambling code associated with a wireless communication. The scrambling code can be generated, for instance, based on sequences identified by indices associated with the PSC. In one aspect, the at least one M-sequence scrambled with the scrambling code can comprise a pair of sequences that are multiplexed to form an SSC. The pair of M-sequences can be scrambled prior to or after such multiplexing. In another aspect, the base M-sequence of the above sequence matrix can be the at least one M-sequence scrambled at reference number 904, such that each variation of the scrambled base Msequence is also scrambled. Accordingly, the sequence matrix comprises scrambled sequences according to such aspect. [00107] At 906, method 900 can generate an SSC based on the scrambled Msequence. As indicated above, the SSC can be generated by multiplexing multiple sequences (e.g., sequence pairs, sequence triplets), truncating one or more bits of such sequences, repeating one or more bits of such sequences, or a combination thereof or of the like, as required to generate an SSC of a desired length (e.g., length-62). At 908, method 900 can map the SSC onto sub-components of an OTA message (e.g., subcarrier channels of an OFDM transmission). [00108] An SSC scrambled with a PSC-based scrambling code, generated by method 900, can provide improved interference characteristics for wireless communication. It should be appreciated that the scrambling code can be generated from the same polynomial utilized to generate the SSC, or a polynomial different than that utilized to generate the SSC. In at least one aspect, the polynomial utilized to generate the scrambling code is of the form l+x L2+xL3+xL4+xL5. Further, such polynomial can be utilized to generate a base scrambling sequence. Cyclic shifted variations of the base scrambling sequence can be generated to provide a scrambling   sequence matrix. In one specific aspect of the subject disclosure, twenty or more cyclic shifted variations of the scrambling sequence are generated and combined with the base scrambling sequence to form the scrambling sequence matrix. According to such aspects, the scrambling code can be generated from substantially three sequences of the scrambling sequence matrix. As an example, the base scrambling sequence, a tenthcyclic shifted variation of the base scrambling sequence, and a twentieth cyclic shifted variation of the base scrambling sequence can be utilized to generate the PSC-based scrambling code. [00109] Fig. 10 depicts a flowchart of a sample methodology 1000 for scrambling OTA SSC transmission according to one or more aspects. Method 1000, at 1002, can generate a sequence matrix as described herein. At 1004, method 1000 can select two sequences from the matrix to generate an SSC. The sequences can be selected based on characteristics of an SSC code resulting from the selected sequences. According to one specific example, the characteristics can comprise a PAPR of the SSC code, a cross-correlation factor of the SSC code, or a suitable combination thereof. [00110] At 1006, method 1000 can determine whether the sequences are first scrambled or multiplexed. Such determination can be based on projected interference characteristics of resulting SSC codes, optionally in conjunction with prevailing wireless transmission characteristics of a RAN (e.g. , multi-path scattering, signal reflection/refraction, or the like, as known in the art of radio frequency propagation and/or mobile communication technology). If the sequences are first multiplexed, method 1000 can proceed to 1014, if the sequences are first scrambled, method 1000 can proceed to 1008. [00111] At 1008, method 1000 can generate a PSC-based scrambling code from a sequence matrix generated from one or more polynomial expressions, as described herein (e.g., see methodology 900, supra). At 1010, the two sequences selected from the sequence matrix can be scrambled utilizing the PSC-based scrambling code. At 1012, the sequences can then be interleaved to form an SSC. The SSC can be mapped to an OTA message and transmitted in conjunction with one or more wireless communications . [00112] At 1014, method 1000 can interleave the two sequences selected from the sequence matrix to form a full-length sequence. At 1016, a full-length scrambling   code can be generated as described herein. At 1018, the full-length sequence can be scrambled by employing the scrambling code generated at reference number 1016. Finally, at 1018, an SSC can be generated from the scrambled interleaved sequences, which can be mapped to the OTA message discussed above. [00113] Fig. 11 illustrates a flowchart of a sample methodology 1100 for generating scrambled SSCs according to at least one aspect. At 1102, method 1100 cangenerate an M-sequence from a polynomial expression. The polynomial expression can, in some instances, have the form xL5 + xL2 + 1 over GF(2). At 1104, method 1100 can scramble the M-sequence with a PSC-based scrambling code. The PSC-based scrambling code can be generated from one or more scrambling sequences obtained from one or more scrambling polynomial expressions. According to at least one aspect, the scrambling polynomial expressions can comprise a single expression of the form l+x L2+xL3+xL4+xL5. [00114] At 1106, the scrambled M-sequence is cyclic shifted n times to create n distinct scrambled variations of the scrambled M-sequence. The scrambled M-sequence and n distinct scrambled variations can be compiled into a scrambled sequence matrix. At 1108, two of the scrambled sequences of the scrambled sequence matrix are selected to form an SSC. The selected sequences can be multiplexed to form a full-length scrambled sequence, as described herein. It should be appreciated that the two selected sequences can be based on underlying characteristics of an SSC derived from the sequences. In one aspect, the underlying characteristic comprises a PAPR of the SSC as compared with a PAPR threshold. In another aspect, the underlying characteristic comprises a cross-correlation factor as compared with a correlation threshold. In yet another aspect, the underlying characteristic comprises a suitable combination of the foregoing. [00115] In at least one further aspect, the two selected sequences can be based on a predetermined number of desired SSCs. As a particular example, where the scrambled sequence matrix comprises 3 1 scrambled sequences of length substantially one half the length of a desired SSC code, 170 or 340 sequence pairs can be selected, based on the PAPR and/or cross-correlation characteristics, discussed above. Selection of SSC sequence pairs in such a manner can provide reduced interference for transmitted synchronization information, potentially reducing power consumption of receiving   devices and improving overall communication quality in a mobile communication environment. Accordingly, method 1100 can provide a significant benefit for various mobile communication technologies, as described herein. [00116] Fig. 12 depicts a block diagram of an example system 1200 that can facilitate wireless communication according to some aspects disclosed herein. On a downlink, at access point 1205, a transmit (TX) data processor 1210 receives, formats, codes, interleaves, and modulates (or symbol maps) traffic data and providesmodulation symbols (\"data symbols\"). A symbol modulator 1215 receives and processes the data symbols and pilot symbols and provides a stream of symbols. A symbol modulator 1220 multiplexes data and pilot symbols and provides them to a transmitter unit (TMTR) 1220. Each transmit symbol can be a data symbol, a pilot symbol, or a signal value of zero. The pilot symbols can be sent continuously in each symbol period. The pilot symbols can be frequency division multiplexed (FDM), orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM), time division multiplexed (TDM), code division multiplexed (CDM), or a suitable combination thereof. [00117] TMTR 1220 receives and converts the stream of symbols into one or more analog signals and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and frequency upconverts) the analog signals to generate a downlink signal suitable for transmission over the wireless channel. The downlink signal is then transmitted through an antenna 1225 to the terminals. At terminal 1230, an antenna 1235 receives the downlink signal and provides a received signal to a receiver unit (RCVR) 1240. Receiver unit 1240 conditions (e.g. , filters, amplifies, and frequency downconverts) the received signal and digitizes the conditioned signal to obtain samples. A symbol demodulator 1245 demodulates and provides received pilot symbols to a processor 1250 for channel estimation. Symbol demodulator 1245 further receives a frequency response estimate for the downlink from processor 1250, performs data demodulation on the received data symbols to obtain data symbol estimates (which are estimates of the transmitted data symbols), and provides the data symbol estimates to an RX data processor 1255, which demodulates (i.e., symbol demaps), deinterleaves, and decodes the data symbol estimates to recover the transmitted traffic data. The processing by symbol demodulator 1245 and RX data processor 1255 is complementary to the processing by symbol modulator 1215 and TX data processor 1210, respectively, at access point 1205.   [00118] On the uplink, a TX data processor 1260 processes traffic data and provides data symbols. A symbol modulator 1265 receives and multiplexes the data symbols with pilot symbols, performs modulation, and provides a stream of symbols. A transmitter unit 1270 then receives and processes the stream of symbols to generate an uplink signal, which is transmitted by the antenna 1235 to the access point 1205. Specifically, the uplink signal can be in accordance with SC-FDMA requirements and can include frequency hopping mechanisms as described herein.[00119] At access point 1205, the uplink signal from terminal 1230 is received by the antenna 1225 and processed by a receiver unit 1275 to obtain samples. A symbol demodulator 1280 then processes the samples and provides received pilot symbols and data symbol estimates for the uplink. An RX data processor 1285 processes the data symbol estimates to recover the traffic data transmitted by terminal 1230. A processor 1290 performs channel estimation for each active terminal transmitting on the uplink. Multiple terminals can transmit pilot concurrently on the uplink on their respective assigned sets of pilot subbands, where the pilot subband sets can be interlaced. [00120] Processors 1290 and 1250 direct (e.g., control, coordinate, manage, etc.) operation at access point 1205 and terminal 1230, respectively. Respective processors 1290 and 1250 can be associated with memory units (not shown) that store program codes and data. Processors 1290 and 1250 can also perform computations to derive frequency and impulse response estimates for the uplink and downlink, respectively. [00121] For a multiple-access system (e.g., SC-FDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, CDMA, TDMA, etc.), multiple terminals can transmit concurrently on the uplink. For such a system, the pilot subbands can be shared among different terminals. The channel estimation techniques can be used in cases where the pilot subbands for each terminal span the entire operating band (possibly except for the band edges). Such a pilot subband structure would be desirable to obtain frequency diversity for each terminal. The techniques described herein can be implemented by various means. For example, these techniques can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, which can be digital, analog, or both digital and analog, the processing units used for channel estimation can be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field   programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof. With software, implementation can be through modules (e.g. , procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described herein. The software codes can be stored in memory unit and executed by the processors 1290 and 1250. [00122] Figs. 13, 14, and 15 provide block diagrams of example systems 1300, 1400, 1500 for implementing various aspects of the subject disclosure. System 1300can comprise a module 1302 for generating a sequence matrix from a base M-sequence and cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence. The base M-sequence can be generated from a polynomial expression, as described herein. Bits of each cyclic shifted variation of the base sequence can be either single shifted, double shifted bits, triple shifted bits, etc., or a suitable combination thereof. The base sequence and the shifted variations can be utilized by the module 1302 to form the sequence matrix. [00123] System 1300 can also include a module 1304 for scrambling one or more of the M-sequences. The module 1304 can employ a scrambling code, such as a PSCbased scrambling code to scramble the M-sequences. The scrambling code can be generated by creating a base scrambling sequence from a polynomial expression {e.g., different from that used to generate the sequence matrix), as described herein. Cyclic shifted variations of the base scrambling sequence can be generated, and one or more of the base scrambling sequence and shifted variations can be utilized to generate the scrambling code. [00124] A module 1306 for generating an SSC can create the SSC utilizing at least one scrambled M-sequence. For instance, the scrambled M-sequence(s) can be interleaved, truncated, repeated, or a combination thereof or of the like, as suitable depending on a length of the at least one scrambled M-sequence compared with a desired length of the SSC. System 1300 can further comprise a module 1308 for mapping the SSC onto an OTA transmission. For instance, bits of the SSC can be mapped to sub-carrier channels of an OFDM transmission, code sub-divisions of a CDMA transmission, time sub-divisions of a TDMA transmission, or suitable combinations of integrated systems. As described, system 1300 can generate scrambled SSC codes exhibiting reduced interference in a mobile communication environment.   [00125] System 1400 can comprise a module 1402 for forming a sequence matrix from a base M-sequence and n cyclic shifted variations of the base M-sequence, as described herein. Further, system 1400 can comprise a module 1404 for indexing sequence pairs of the sequence matrix. The module can generate at least (n+l) L2 indices for each distinct sequence pair of the sequence matrix. Furthermore, system 1400 can comprise a module 1406 for determining PAPR and/or correlation of SSC codes resulting from sequence pairs. The module 1406 can select a predetermined number of sequence pairs {e.g., substantially 170 sequence pairs, substantially 340 sequence pairs, or other suitable number based at least in part on a number of basestations in a mobile site etc.) meeting PAPR and/or cross-correlation thresholds {e.g., below a desired PAPR and/or below a desired correlation factor). Accordingly, SSCs resulting from the selected sequence pairs can have desired transmission characteristics resulting in improved wireless transmission. [00126] System 1500 can comprise a module 1502 for receiving wireless transmissions. The module 1502 can receive one or more wireless OTA transmissions from a mobile network transmitter {e.g., base station(s)). The module 1502 can comprise one or more wireless antenna\\'s {e.g., radio antenna), a receiver for pre conditioning received signals, or the like. System 1500 can further comprise a module 1504 for extracting an SSC from transmissions received by module 1502. Extraction can be based on signal demodulation, conditioning, and the like, as known in the art. A module 1506 for descrambling the SSC can employ a common PSC-based binary descrambling code to decipher the SSC. In one aspect, the descrambling code can be substantially similar to a scrambling code used to scramble the SSC, or a variation {e.g., by inverting the bits of the scrambling code) of such scrambling code. Additionally, system 1500 can comprise a module 1508 for determining an identity of the mobile network transmitter from the deciphered SSC. For instance, a transmitter ID encoded into the SSC can be read and cross-referenced with an ID stored in memory. The transmitter ID can be utilized, for instance, to facilitate wireless communication between a mobile device and the mobile network transmitter. Where received signals exhibit reduced interference, system 1500 can provide reduced power consumption and improved communication reliability in a mobile communication environment.CLAIMS']"
