       "['WO 2011/024734 PCT/JP2010/064128 DESCRIPTION Title of Invention ACTINIC RAY-SENSITIVE OR RADIATION-SENSITIVE RESIN COMPOSITION, AND RESIST FILM AND PATTERN FORMING METHOD USING THE SAME Technical Field The present invention relates to an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition for use in the production process of a semiconductor device such as IC, in the production of a liquid crystal device or a circuit board such as thermal head and further in other photofabrication processes, and a pattern forming method using the composition. More specifically, the present invention relates to an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition suitable when using a far ultraviolet ray at a wavelength of 250 nm or less, an electron beam or the like as the light source, and a resist film and a pattern forming method each using the composition. Background Art A chemical amplification resist produces an acid in the exposed area upon irradiation with radiation such as far ultraviolet light and through a reaction using the acid as a catalyst, causes a change in the developer solubility of the area irradiated with radiation and that of the non-irradiated area, thereby forming a pattern on a substrate. In the case of using a KrF excimer laser as the exposure light source, a good pattern with high sensitivity and high resolution is formed because a resin exhibiting small absorption mainly in the 248-nm region and having poly(hydroxystyrene) as the basic structure is used as the main component, and this is a good system as compared with the conventional naphthoquinone diazide/novolak resin system. On the other hand, in the case where a light source at a shorter wavelength, for example, an ArF excimer laser (193 nm) is used as the exposure light source, even the above-described chemical amplification system is not sufficient because the compound having an aromatic group inherently exhibits large absorption in the 193-nm region. Therefore, various resists for an ArF excimer laser, containing an alicyclic hydrocarbon structure, have been developed. However, in view of overall performance as a resist, it is in fact very difficult to find out an appropriate combination of a resin, a photo-acid generator, additives, a solvent and the like used. In JP-A-2006-330098 (the term \"JP-A\" as used herein means an \"unexamined published Japanese patent application\") and Japanese Patent 3,577,743, it is proposed to 1  WO 2011/024734 PCT/JP2010/064128 solve the problem (PED) related to the length of time from exposure to post-exposure bake (PEB) and satisfy the pattern profile or suppression of the line edge roughness by using a specific compound capable of decomposing upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation. In the latest-generation pattern formation with a line width of 45 nm or less, where an immersion process is applied, the above-described related arts are not necessarily sufficient, and more improvements are demanded in terms of line width roughness (LWR) and depth-of-focus (DOF). Summary of Invention Considering those problems in the background art, an object of the present invention is to provide an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition improved in LWR and DOF and suitable also for an immersion process with a line width of 45 nm or less, and a resist film and a pattern forming method each using the composition. The above-described object can be attained by the following techniques. That is, the present invention includes the following configurations. (1) An actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition, comprising: (PA) a compound having a proton acceptor functional group and undergoing decomposition upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation to generate a compound reduced in or deprived of proton acceptor property or changed to be acidic from being proton acceptor-functioning, wherein a molar extinction coefficient e of the compound (PA) at a wavelength of 193 nm as measured in acetonitrile solvent is 55,000 or less. (2) The actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition as described in (1) above, further comprising: (Bl) a resin capable of increasing a solubility of the resin (Bl) in an alkali developer by an action of an acid, wherein the resin (Bl) contains a resin having a repeating unit represented by the following formula (V), and the compound (PA) is a compound capable of decomposing upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation to generate a compound represented by the following formula (PA-1): Q-ApAj-(X)n-R (PA-1) wherein Q represents -SO3H, -CO2H or -W|-NH-W2-Rf; each of X, Wj and W2 independently represents -SO2- or -CO-; Rf represents an alkyl group which may be substituted with a halogen atom, a 2 ',\n",
